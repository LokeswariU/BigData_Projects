It was shared on the group as a prank.""","This should never happen,” “Islam is and always will be a curse,” “Get them out of our country – frightening times we are living in,” and: “I thought it would be like this in the year 2050, but it is happening NOW,” according to thelocal.no and other media.The photograph, found on the internet, was posted “for a joke” last week by Johan Slåttavik, who has since described himself as “Norway’s worst web troll and proud of it”, beneath a question asking the group: “What do people think of this?”Slåttavik told Nettavisen and Norway’s TV2 he wanted to “highlight the difference between legitimate criticism of immigration and blind racism”, and was “interested to see how people’s perceptions of an image are influenced by how others around them react.Comments posted on Norwegian ‘Fatherland first’ Facebook group call empty seats on bus ‘terrifying’ Jon Henley European affairs correspondent  Wed 2 Aug 2017 06.26 EDT   Last modified on Mon 1 Jan 2018 04.24 EST  A Norwegian anti-immigrant group has been roundly ridiculed after members apparently mistook a photograph of six empty bus seats posted on its Facebook page for a group of women wearing burqas.“Tragic”, “terrifying” and “disgusting” were among the comments posted by members of the closed Fedrelandet viktigst, or “Fatherland first”, group beneath the photograph, according to screenshots on the Norwegian news website Nettavisen.Other members of the 13,000-strong group, for people “who love Norway and appreciate what our ancestors fought for”, wondered whether the non-existent passengers might be carrying bombs or weapons beneath their clothes.The comments suggested the vast majority of the anti-immigrant group’s members saw the photo as evidence of the ongoing “Islamification” of Norway, although a small number pointed out it was in fact a picture of bus seats.I ended up having a good laugh.”It went viral in Norway after Sindre Beyer, a former Labour party MP who said he has been following Fatherland first for some time, published 23 pages of screenshots of the group’s outraged comments.“What happens when a photo of some empty bus seats is posted to a disgusting Facebook group, and nearly everyone thinks they see a bunch of burqas?” he asked in a post shared more than 1,800 times.So much hatred against empty bus seats certainly shows that prejudice wins out over wisdom.”The head of Norway’s Antiracist Centre, Rune Berglund Steen, told the site that people plainly “see what they want to see – and what these people want to see are dangerous Muslims”.Norway recently became the latest European country to propose restrictions on the wearing of burqas and niqabs, tabling a law that will bar them from kindergartens, schools and universities."
1,"Investigators have released pictures showing how close an Air Canada flight came to crashing onto four planes at a US airport last month. Its pilots mistakenly descended towards a taxiway, where four planes were parked, instead of the runway before aborting the landing. Investigators said the incident came within a few feet of becoming one of the worst aviation disasters.","The Air Canada pilots mistook the taxiway for the runway next to it and flew their jet to just 59ft (18m) above ground before pulling up to attempt another landing, according to National Transportation Safety Board information released on Wednesday.That’s barely taller than the four planes that were on the taxiway when the incident occurred late at night on 7 July.The captain, who was flying the plane, had more than 20,000 hours of flying time, and the co-pilot had about 10,000 hours.The pilots told investigators “that they did not recall seeing aircraft on taxiway but that something did not look right to them,” the NTSB said.Investigators could not hear what the Air Canada captain and co-pilot said to each other during the aborted landing because their conversation was recorded over when the plane made other flights, starting with a San Francisco-to-Montreal trip the next morning.NTSB investigators said they have not determined probable cause for the incident that came within a few feet of becoming one of the worst disasters in aviation history.“It was close, much too close,” said John Cox, a safety consultant and retired airline pilot.The investigators said that as the Air Canada jet approached the taxiway just before midnight after a flight from Toronto, it was so far off course that it did not appear on a radar system used to prevent runway collisions.Those systems were not designed to spot planes that are lined up to land on a taxiway a rare occurrence, especially for airline pilots.Pilots in a United plane alerted air traffic controllers about the off-course jet, while the crew of a Philippine Airlines jet behind it switched on their plane’s landing lights in an apparent last-ditch danger signal to Air Canada.Recorders are required to capture only the last two hours of a plane’s flying time.Peter Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for Air Canada, declined to comment, citing the investigation."

18,"""Canada is investigating reports that Saudi Arabia has been using Canadian-made armoured vehicles against its citizens in the violence-hit Eastern Province. Videos and photos posted on social media show Saudi Arabia using Canadian equipment on Shia dissidents. Canada warned it would take action if """"it is found that Canadian exports have been used to commit serious violations of human rights"""".""","Campaigners called the ruling a “green light” for the UK to sell arms to “brutal dictatorships and human rights abusers”.In Canada, Amnesty International pointed to the indications that Canadian vehicles are being used against civilians to call on the Liberal government to reverse its support of the billion-dollar arms deal.“Mounting tensions and conflict in eastern Saudi Arabia, about which the Canadian government has rightly expressed public concern, further indicate how fraught it is for Canada to have authorised the sale of light armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia at this time,” secretary-general Alex Neve said in a statement.In a statement issued last week, it highlighted the causalities among civilians and security forces and urged Riyadh to confront its security challenges in “a manner that abides by international human rights law”.Days later, the ministry said the government was actively seeking more information about the reports of civilian casualties and claims that Canadian-made vehicles were involved.Several sources told the Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail that the vehicles being used appeared to be Gurkha RPVs made in Ontario by Terradyne Armoured Vehicles.Others have pointed to Canadian rules that restrict arms exports to countries with poor human rights records and prohibit exports if there is a possibility that the buyer could use the arms against its own population.“People have to know that when you sign a deal with Canada, a change in governments won’t immediately scrap the jobs and benefits coming from it,” the prime minister told the Toronto Star last year."
19,"US President Donald Trump personally dictated a misleading statement which his son Donald Trump Jr delivered on his meeting with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential election campaign, according to a Washington Post report. In his statement, Trump Jr said he discussed the adoption of Russian children with the lawyer who had offered damaging information on Hillary Clinton.","But the new report that Trump personally oversaw the issuing of a misleading account of the proceedings raises questions about the president’s role in what could be conceived as a cover-up.It comes as Mueller has already expanded his inquiry to include the issue of whether Trump was engaging in a possible obstruction of justice when he fired James Comey, having tried and failed to persuade the then director of the FBI to back off investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s contacts with Russian officials.A lawyer for the president issued the Washington Post with a curt statement: “Apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent,” Jay Sekulow said.The new details of the president’s role in what turned out to be a major communications fiasco come on the day that his current communications chief, Anthony Scaramucci, was dismissed from the White House after barely 11 days.One of the Russian visitors was the well-connected lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.The report, based on multiple though largely anonymous sources that included the president’s own advisers, has the potential to cause political, and even legal, trouble for the White House because it draws Trump himself much closer into the fray over the Trump Tower meeting, which has become a lightning rod in the Russian affair.Shunning the guidance of lawyers and overturning the view apparently reached by Kushner and his team of advisers that a full and frank accounting should be made, Trump reportedly dictated a statement on board Air Force One as he was flying back to Washington from the G20 summit in Germany.But as the Washington Post’s forensic deconstruction of the framing of the Trump Tower meeting shows, the president himself has the capacity to destroy even the best-laid plans, underlining the task now facing his new chief of staff.According to the Post, senior White House officials together with the circle around Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, had spent days rehearsing various ways to address the Trump Tower meeting publicly.Kushner’s team was reported to have decided that it was better to “err on the side of transparency” because the whole truth would eventually come out.Trump, however, appeared to have seen things differently.But within 24 hours, highly damaging revelations had emerged that made clear the meeting had been much more charged than that.On 9 July, the Times revealed that Trump Jr had been lured into talking to Veselnitskaya by the promise of negative intelligence on his father’s presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, and two days after that the email chain was published that showed the younger Trump reveling in the idea of receiving dirt on the Democratic presidential candidate, uttering the gleeful phrase: “I love it”.The Trump Tower meeting has proved to be one of the most toxic pieces of information to emerge so far in the billowing investigation into possible ties between Trump associates and Russia in the Kremlin’s efforts to skew the presidential outcome in favor of the Republican nominee.As would soon become apparent, it gave a very partial and distorted account of events.In the release the 2016 meeting was presented, in Trump’s own words, as “a short introductory meeting” dominated by discussion of the adoption of Russian children that was “not a campaign issue at the time”.That statement was presented to the New York Times on 8 July, and duly included in the newspaper’s first account of the meeting."
20,"More than half of university students in Australia were sexually harassed at least once in 2016, according to a Human Rights Commission survey. With over 30,000 responses registered across the country, it was found that women experienced harassment and assaults at higher rates than men.

It was Cormier's second loss of his MMA career, with the first also having come against Jones.","After Jones said he doubted Lesnar would ever accept a fight with him, Lesnar told the AP that he would meet Jones “anytime, anywhere.”Lesnar is at least considering a return to the sport in which he won a UFC title in just his fourth professional fight.UFC president Dana White was in the cage when Jones called out Lesnar, and the promotion is aware of the growing buzz surrounding the matchup.Associated Press  Sun 30 Jul 2017 01.18 EDT   Last modified on Sun 30 Jul 2017 05.30 EDT  Jon Jones had barely reclaimed his UFC title when he called out Brock Lesnar to be his next opponent.And Lesnar was listening.Right after Jones stopped Daniel Cormier in the third round at UFC 214 on Saturday, he reignited his growing rivalry with Lesnar, the former UFC heavyweight champion.“Brock Lesnar, if you want to know what it feels like to get your ass kicked by a guy who weighs 40 pounds less than you, meet me in the octagon,” Jones said on the pay-per-view broadcast.The Associated Press reached Lesnar shortly after he watched the championship fight and then heard Jones call him out.“Be careful what you wish for, young man,” Lesnar replied.A heavyweight superfight between Jones and Lesnar would be one of the biggest events in UFC history.Jones is the light heavyweight champion, but has long contemplated a move up to heavyweight – and his post-fight comments make it clear that he’s interested.Lesnar beat Mark Hunt at UFC 200 in a unanimous decision that was changed to a no-contest after the failed test.Lesnar is an extraordinary pay-per-view draw as likely the most popular fighter in mixed martial arts, while Jones’ victory over Cormier is expected to put him back atop most pound-for-pound lists as the world’s best fighter.Lesnar returned to MMA last year with a victory, but he is under contract to the WWE as a professional wrestler until next spring.Jones and Lesnar traded verbal jabs earlier in the week.White is also aware of the obstacles in its way, including the remainder of Lesnar’s suspension for failing a doping test last year.“It’s fun to talk about, but the reality of it happening anytime soon, it’s not a reality,” White said.But it’s definitely a lucrative possibility if Lesnar decides to resume training for MMA."

In the case, a banker alleged that during a ?night of heavy drinking?, Ashley agreed to pay him �15 million if company?s shares doubled. However, the judge said nobody would've thought what Ashley said in the pub was ?serious?.","“But there is no evidence to suggest that Mr Ashley has ever negotiated or concluded a contract at one of these meetings.“The evening at the Horse and Groom was, in any event, a considerably less formal occasion than the senior management meetings, as there was no agenda or structure for the occasion and the conversation was largely social or general chat, rather than being specifically directed to any business subject.” Ashley was not in court to hear the judge deliver his ruling, but his lawyers said he had won a “comprehensive” victory.In a statement, the businessman said: “The only reason the Sports Direct share price exceeded £8, and will hopefully do so again, is because of the sterling efforts of all the people who work at Sports Direct.”Ashley, who gave evidence at the trial, said he could not recall making the alleged deal and if he had it would have been “obviously just banter”.He had told the court that he had met Blue, who was then an adviser to Sports Direct, and three other finance specialists at the Horse & Groom pub and “consumed a lot of alcohol”.“I can’t remember the details of the conversations that we had in the pub as it was a heavy night of drinking,” Ashley had said.He said the work ethic at Sports Direct was “like nothing else I have ever seen”, but he said Ashley sometimes did business “in unorthodox ways and in unusual venues”.Blue claimed Ashley once vomited into a fireplace after a senior management meeting that was “effectively a pub lock-in” and said the businessman would take naps under tables at “boring” meetings.Lawyers told the judge that Ashley had run up legal bills of £1.5m, and Blue bills of “£1m-odd”.Investment banker Jeffrey Blue loses claim against Sports Direct and Newcastle United owner over deal allegedly made in pub Simon Goodleyand agencies  Wed 26 Jul 2017 11.34 EDT   First published on Wed 26 Jul 2017 05.30 EDT  Newcastle United owner and Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has won a high court battle over a £15m deal allegedly made in a London pub, calling time on a case that will be long remembered for days of evidence concerning excessive alcohol consumption.The case revolved around investment banker Jeffrey Blue’s allegation that during a “night of heavy drinking” at the Horse and Groom pub near Sports Direct’s Oxford Street store in January 2013, Ashley agreed to pay him £15m if the company’s shares doubled to £8.However, on Wednesday, Mr Justice Leggatt, who had said he found the case was “a lot more interesting than some”, ruled that no one would have thought what Ashley said in the pub was “serious”.“The Sports Direct senior management meetings certainly show that Mr Ashley is happy to combine discussion of business matters with the consumption of alcohol,” the judge said in his ruling.“If I did say to Mr Blue that I would pay him £15m if he could increase [Sports Direct’s] share price to £8, it would be obvious to everyone, including Mr Blue, that I wasn’t being serious.” He said he paid Blue, whom he called “Jeffers”, £1m for “other deals” unrelated to the night in the Horse & Groom.Sports Direct’s shares hit the £8 price target in February 2014.The judge said Blue would have to pick up Ashley’s legal bills and £600,000 would have to be paid on account within the next month.Lawyers indicated that Blue had been “assisted” by insurers in launching the litigation."

The study disproves traditional practice of completing courses, which claims that taking too few tablets allows the disease-causing bacteria to mutate and become resistant to the drug.","The longer such bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, the more likely it is that resistance will develop.The experts say there has been too little research into the ideal length of a course of antibiotics, which also varies from one individual to the next, depending in part on what antibiotics they have taken in the past.In hospital, patients can be tested to work out when to stop the drugs.Experts suggest patients should stop taking the drugs when they feel better rather than completing their prescription Sarah Boseley  Wed 26 Jul 2017 18.30 EDT   Last modified on Mon 27 Nov 2017 14.27 EST  Telling patients to stop taking antibiotics when they feel better may be preferable to instructing them to finish the course, according to a group of experts who argue that the rule long embedded in the minds of doctors and the public is wrong and should be overturned.Patients have traditionally been told that they must complete courses of antibiotics, the theory being that taking too few tablets will allow the bacteria causing their disease to mutate and become resistant to the drug.But Martin Llewelyn, a professor in infectious diseases at Brighton and Sussex medical school, and colleagues claim that this is not the case.In an analysis in the British Medical Journal, the experts say “the idea that stopping antibiotic treatment early encourages antibiotic resistance is not supported by evidence, while taking antibiotics for longer than necessary increases the risk of resistance”.There are some diseases where the bug can become resistant if the drugs are not taken for long enough.“The evidence for ‘completing the course’ is poor, and the length of the course of antibiotics has been estimated based on a fear of under-treating rather than any studies,” she said.“The evidence for shorter courses of antibiotics being equal to longer courses, in terms of cure or outcome, is generally good, although more studies would help and there are a few exceptions when longer courses are better – for example, TB.”But the Royal College of GPs expressed concerns."

Despacito!” goes the Socialist Party-sanctioned remix of the catchy dance song, which was played during Maduro’s weekly televised show.He says it is the only way to bring peace back to the convulsed nation.“That you illegally appropriate a song (Despacito) does not compare with the crimes you commit and have committed in Venezuela."

68,"Israel has removed metal detectors from the entrance of Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque following days of violent protests over the installation. The move is aimed at ending the crisis which claimed seven lives, Israeli officials said. The Palestinians reportedly see the installation of metal detectors as an Israeli attempt to assert control over the holy site.","Sabri said: “Our position is that for now, nobody should enter” the shrine.The removal of the detectors on Tuesday appeared to be part of a deal under which Israeli diplomats were repatriated from Jordan, including an embassy security guard who was involved in a fatal shooting of two Jordanians on Sunday night.The brief statement said the Israeli security cabinet, which met on Monday evening, had “accepted the recommendation of all of the security bodies to incorporate security measures based on advanced technologies (‘smart checks’) and other measures instead of metal detectors in order to ensure the security of visitors and worshippers in the Old City and on the Temple Mount”.The statement added that under the plan Israeli police would “reinforce” their presence around the holy site.The street says yes and we say yes; if the street says no to the measures, we will say no.”There has been increasing criticism of the way the metal detectors were installed, without consultation with the waqf and reportedly over the objections of senior Israeli security officials who had warned of the risk of bloodshed.On Monday night Israeli diplomats were evacuated from the embassy in the Jordanian capital, Amman, after Sunday’s shooting of two Jordanians by a security guard.The diplomats, including Israel’s ambassador to Jordan, Einat Schlain, crossed the Allenby bridge border in a convoy, arriving back in Israel at around 11pm.Among those repatriated were the security guard whom Jordan had originally said it wanted to retain for questioning over the incident.A Jordanian news site linked to the kingdom’s military said investigators had determined that the altercation at the embassy compound was not politically motivated and that one of the Jordanians, a 17-year-old, had attacked the guard with a screwdriver in a dispute about a furniture delivery.Under an agreement negotiated by the head of Israel’s domestic security service, who had been sent to Amman to negotiate, Israel agreed that Jordanian police could hear the guard’s description of the incident in the presence of Israeli diplomats.Netanyahu’s office said the return of the diplomats had been made possible “thanks to close cooperation which was held in the past day between Israel and Jordan”.Muslim religious officials – who allege Israel is trying to expand its control at the site – said they would accept only a return to the arrangements for access to the compound that had been in place before an incident on 14 Julywhen two Israeli policemen were shot by three Israeli Arab gunmen who had smuggled weapons on to the site.“This movement is a movement of the street,” said Sheikh Raed Dana of the waqf, the Islamic endowments organisation that administers the mosque compound, commenting on whether he believed worshippers should end protests and return to the shrine.“The dangers on the ground will escalate if we go through another cycle of Friday prayer without a resolution.” He said events in east Jerusalem were not “localised” but “affect millions if not billions of people around the world”.Even before the Israeli decision to remove the devices, it was unclear whether such a move would be sufficient to end the violence."
69,"Top Communist Party of China politician Sun Zhengcai, who was considered a potential successor to President Xi Jinping, is reportedly being investigated for corruption by his party. The probe against Zhengcai, who was recently ejected from his role as Party's Secretary for Chongqing city, eliminates him from the contest to become China's next President.","In doing so, some experts fear Xi may also have set in motion a new phase of political turbulence in the world’s number two economy.“A smooth leadership transition is really crucial to the survival of Chinese Communist party rule in China and this really throws a monkey wrench into the machine,” said Susan Shirk, a US expert in elite Chinese politics who was deputy assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton.Shirk said that for almost two decades China’s rulers had abided by an unofficial succession system designed to prevent both cut-throat and destabilising internecine power struggles and the rise of strongman dictators who could cling to power until they died or were violently overthrown.According to those unwritten rules, presumptive heirs to the Communist party’s top two jobs, general secretary and premier, should be informally anointed five years ahead of a full leadership transition, as had happened with Xi and Li in 2007.Many fear his downfall signals turbulent times in Beijing Tom Phillips in Beijing  Tue 25 Jul 2017 02.36 EDT   Last modified on Tue 25 Jul 2017 02.52 EDT  He studied agriculture in rural England and was tipped by some as China’s future leader.But on Tuesday morning Sun Zhengcai’s political obituary was splashed across the front page of the Communist party’s official mouthpiece in a damning editorial entitled: “Rule strictly over the party with iron discipline.”“The investigation into comrade Sun Zhengcai sounds the alarm bell for the party,” the People’s Daily article warned, as it announced that the youngest member of China’s political elite had been ejected from power for a “serious violation of discipline”.“Top cadres must hold firm political positions, temper their political characters … and act in a manner consistent with the party’s central committee with [president] Xi Jinping as its core,” the broadsheet declared.Li, an authority on the Communist party’s elite, said that even before the purge: “I have talked to many people who know Sun [and they said] … ‘That guy has a very strong personal ambition; you simply cannot believe what he says and what he promises’.“In Chinese, you use the term ‘yóu’ [slippery or cunning].”Bill Bishop, the publisher of the influential Sinocism newsletter, said Sun’s demise was further proof that Xi – who took power in 2012 and has been called China’s most dominant leader since Mao – was a masterful and steely political strategist.As he sought to cement his status as China’s omnipotent ‘Chairman of Everything’, Xi was using anti-corruption investigators to pick off rivals, who were replaced with supporters.Just a few weeks ago, Sun, a 53-year-old former agriculture minister who studied farming at Hertfordshire’s Rothamstad research centre in the 1990s, was the high-flying party chief of one of the world’s fastest-growing cities, the sweltering Yangtze port of Chongqing.Many believed he was being groomed for greatness and would use that job – handed to him in late 2012 after the sensational downfall of flamboyant party leader Bo Xilai – as a springboard from which to leap into one of seven highly-coveted spots on China’s top ruling body, the politburo standing committee.Sun’s successor in Chongqing, Chen Min’er, who worked under Xi during his five years as Zhejiang province’s party boss, now appears poised to claim a seat at the party’s top table at this autumn’s congress.“Xi certainly looks like he would make Machiavelli – and Mao – quite proud,” Bishop said.Shirk, the chair of the 21st Century China Centre at the University of California, San Diego, said she saw Sun’s downfall not as as sign of Xi’s strength, but of the fragility of China’s political system."

The plans also list 17 other items that will no longer be prescribed for reasons ranging from low clinical to low cost-effectiveness.","“We need to end unnecessary expense to give us a bigger therapeutic bang for the NHS buck, so we cut the fat and build the therapeutic muscle,” he said.A spokeswoman for the BMA said the organisation “believes there should be no further NHS funding for homeopathy” adding that “limited and scarce NHS resources should only be used to support medicines and treatment that have been shown to be effective.”But Cristal Sumner, chief executive of the British Homeopathic Association said the NHS plans were “bad for its already overstretched budget and for patients” and criticised the report used to draw up the new guidelines.“This recommendation is not cost effective as patients will be prescribed more expensive conventional drugs in place of homeopathy, which defeats the object of the exercise,” she said.Meanwhile, NHS England has been accused of introducing “ability to pay” through the back door by forcing patients to pay for other products it claims are “ineffective, over-priced and low value”, instead of giving prescriptions for them.According to the draft consultation, prescriptions for homeopathic treatments cost NHS England £92,412 in 2016, and at least £578,000 over the past five years.Announcing the plans, Simon Stevens, NHS England’s chief executive, said homeopathy is “at best a placebo and a misuse of scarce NHS funds”.Besides homeopathy, the plans highlight 17 other items that will no longer be available on prescription for reasons ranging from low clinical effectiveness to low cost-effectiveness.“Therefore, it is high time that the NHS stops funding it and instead employs our scarce resources on treatments that are backed by sound science.”The view was echoed by Michael Marshall, project director of the Good Thinking Society, an organisation that previously threatened the Department of Health with a judicial review if it failed to put complementary and alternative therapies on the blacklist for prescriptions.“This is very welcome news,” said Marshall.This breaks with the principle of ‘free at the point of use’ guaranteed by the NHS constitution.” The NHS constitution states that: “Access to NHS services is based on clinical need, not an individual’s ability to pay; NHS services are free of charge, except in limited circumstances sanctioned by parliament.”These include herbal medicines, Omega-3 fatty acid compounds, rubs and ointments used to relieve muscle pain known as rubefacients, and travel vaccines including hepatitis B, yellow fever and rabies that are not available on the NHS for travel, but are sometimes erroneously given.The public funding of homeopathic remedies has long been controversial, with both the British Medical Association and the House of Commons’ science and technology committee having called for an end to their prescription on NHS, pointing out that such remedies are merely placebos."

103,"British cyclist Chris Froome won his third consecutive and fourth overall Tour de France, finishing the race in 86 hours 20 minutes 55 seconds in Paris on Sunday. The 32-year-old rider, who finished the event with a 54-second lead, has moved within one win of the all-time record. The 3,540-km 23-day long Grand Tour, featured a total of 198 riders.","Some days will live in the memory: the moyenne montagne stage to Les Rousses won by Lilian Calmejane, Steve Cummings’s attempt to take the stage to Peyragudes, Sunweb’s battle with Quick-Step on the road to Romans-sur-Isère on behalf of their sprinters Mike Matthews and Marcel Kittel, Alberto Contador’s raging against the dying of the light en route to Foix and Serre-Chevalier, and Edvald Boasson Hagen’s cunning on Friday at Salon-de-Provence.Two stages can be seen as key episodes in the picaresque three-week soap opera: the Düsseldorf time trial, because of the time gained by Froome, and the message it sent about the probable outcome in Marseille three weeks later, and Chambéry, with the crash that eliminated Richie Porte – whose BMC team looked second strongest to Sky – and which put Daniel Martin physically and temporally on the back foot for the rest of the race.What of the opposition?This is the Team Sky approach of winning at all costs; in this case the cost has to be borne by him.For the neutral there was much unbridled bike racing by individuals of character and panache to be savoured through the 2017 Tour, with the unfortunate proviso that very little of it actually involved the battle for the overall title.In an understandable attempt to put Paris on display as never before, the race was routed through the Grand Palais with the riders racing under the famous glass roof, originally erected in 1897 for the universal exposition of the turn of the century.For Chris Froome it was but a novel diversion en route to confirmation of his fourth Tour de France victory.Coming as it did the day after the start and finish in Marseille’s Stade Vélodrome – albeit far from full due to the fact that few ticket holders wanted to stay in the stands all day – the Grand Palais detour was further evidence that the Tour is constantly looking for new ways to reinvent itself, and a reminder that it increasingly sees itself as a way of showing this multifaceted country to the world.Lockdown could serve as a metaphor for the Tour as a whole, given the way the overall battle had panned out since the race left Düsseldorf 22 days ago.Hinault, in 1982, faced the same issue that confronted Froome as he approached Paris on Sunday: a Tour without a stage win, and the consequent carps about a lack of panache.The Badger’s response was to win the bunch sprint on the Champs Élysées, but this is not one from the Froome copybook."

","The material was handed over to the FBI, which transmitted the list to Interpol for global sharing.A note appended to the Interpol list circulated in Italy explains how the terrorist database was constructed, putting together the pieces of the puzzle from hundreds of elements, mainly gathered when Isis local headquarters were captured.“The people,” the note says, “have been identified through materials found in the hiding places of Isil, the Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant.” The note adds that “it emerges that those subjects may have manifested willingness to commit a suicidal attack or martyrdom to support Islam”.The list shows the suspects’ names, the date Isis recruited them, their last likely address including the mosque at which they have been praying while away fighting, their mother’s name and any photographs.For each of the fighters, an ID was created to ensure that each member country in the Interpol network could integrate the data with local databases.Interpol has asked its national partners for any information they might have about each name on the list, and any other background personal data they have on their files, such as border crossings, previous criminal offences, biometric data, passport numbers, activity on social media and travel history.The information will then be included in Interpol’s ASF (automatic search facility) database in order to possibly put the names on a higher level watch list.US intelligence is apparently confident about the reliability of the sources used to compile the list.Exclusive: Agency believes the fighters could have been trained to bomb Europe as revenge for military defeats in Middle East Lorenzo Tondo,  Patrick Wintour and Piero Messina  Fri 21 Jul 2017 15.30 EDT   Last modified on Sat 14 Apr 2018 13.53 EDT  Interpol has circulated a list of 173 Islamic State fighters it believes could have been trained to mount suicide attacks in Europe in revenge for the group’s military defeats in the Middle East.The global crime fighting agency’s list was drawn up by US intelligence from information captured during the assault on Isis territories in Syria and Iraq.European counter-terror networks are concerned that as the Isis “caliphate” collapses, there is an increasing risk of determined suicide bombers seeking to come to Europe, probably operating alone.There is no evidence that any of the people on the list, whose names the Guardian has obtained, have yet entered Europe, but the Interpol circulation, designed to see if EU intelligence sources have any details on the individuals, underlines the scale of the challenge facing Europe.The list, sent out by the general secretariat of Interpol on 27 May, defines the group of fighters as individuals that “may have been trained to build and position improvised explosive devices in order to cause serious deaths and injuries.In 2015 the UN considered there were 20,000 foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria, of whom 4,000 were from Europe, but there has not previously been a specific list of those fighters including those born in the Middle East who have been identified as potential suicide bombers.The speed with which Isis fighters are likely to attempt to reach Europe will depend on a range of issues including whether the group tries to set up a new base in Syria in the wake of the impending fall of Raqqa, its last major redoubt in north-west Syria.“It is the member country which provides the information that decides which other countries it can be shared with.“The purpose of sending these alerts and updates is to ensure that vital policing information is made available when and where it is needed, in line with a member country’s request.”A European counter-terrorism officer said one of the purposes of circulating the list around Europe was to identify those on it who might have been born and raised in European countries.The parallel advance on Raqqa, the group’s other urban stronghold in the region, has been stalled partly due to the severity of the resistance being mounted against the Syrian Democratic Forces made up of an alliance of Kurds, Arabs and US Special forces."

Hale, who joined the Supreme Court in 2009, will earn �225,000 a year as the President. She had earlier served as a counsel to Queen Elizabeth.","Neuberger said: “I have had the pleasure of working closely with Lady Hale over the last five years, and have seen at first hand the intellect and humanity with which she approaches the appeals which come before her, as well as her commitment to the rule of law, legal education and building public understanding of the work of the courts.“For Lady Hale to become president of the institution to which she has contributed so much is a fitting pinnacle to a truly ground-breaking career.”Hale has criticised the inbuilt bias in choosing judges, and the dependence on “soundings” from judges, as producing a judiciary that is “not only mainly male, overwhelmingly white, but also largely the product of a limited range of educational institutions and social backgrounds”.Born in Yorkshire in 1945, she went to a state school, Richmond high school for girls, and then to Girton College, Cambridge, where she read law and graduated top of her class.Hale’s career began in academia when she joined the University of Manchester law faculty as a junior lecturer.She was also the first woman and youngest person to be appointed to the Law Commission.In 1989, she was appointed Queen’s counsel and in 1994 she became a high court judge, the first to have made her career as an academic and public servant rather than as a practising barrister.In 1999, she became the second woman to be appointed to the court of appeal; Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss was the first.Two other court of appeal judges, David Lloyd Jones and Michael Briggs, were also appointed to the supreme court on Friday.A family law expert, Hale joined the supreme court in 2009 and is among the last of the judges who can serve to 75 as she became a judge before rules were changed in 1995 to make retiring at 70 mandatory.She will earn £225,000 a year as the head of the court.In June 2013, she was appointed deputy president of the supreme court.Like Hale, Black is a family law specialist – although she initially took on a broad range of criminal and civil work at the bar – and worked in academia, having taught at then Leeds Polytechnic in the 1980s.A champion of diversity in the judiciary, Lady Hale will take up role as head of the UK’s highest court in October Haroon Siddique  Fri 21 Jul 2017 07.42 EDT   Last modified on Mon 27 Nov 2017 14.45 EST  Brenda Hale has been appointed as the first female president of the UK supreme court.Lady Hale is a longstanding champion of diversity in the judiciary."

The loss was caused by 212 students who continued to stay in hostels without paying the hostel fees after failing to complete the course.","Jump to navigationSpeak NowStudents overstaying and non completing their film courses at the Film and Television Institute of India have resulted in losses to the tune of up to Rs 11.83 crore, the Comptroller and Auditor General said today in a report.The massive revenue loss was caused by 212 students who failed to complete their course work, resulting in them staying on in hostels beyond the schedule completion of their academic terms.According to the CAG report, the failure of the students to complete their respective courses within the prescribed time period also resulted in admissions being held up during the academic years of 2010-11, 2014-15 and 2015-16.The 212 students continued to be on the academic roll and in hotels without any paying any fees/hostel charges, resulting in a revenue loss of Rs 11.83 crore.The CAG also said that it found cases of irregular payment of service tax, excess release of advance payment and unfruitful expenditure on consultancy fees without any commensurate benefits.STUDENTS OVERSTAYEDBetween 2006 and 2012, 315 students were admitted on a total capacity of 352 seats for various six-month diploma courses.Of these, 212 students were still on the academic roll as of March 31, 2016, as they failed to compelte their academic exercises, projects and other course work.Of the total revenue loss of Rs 11.83 crore, Rs 2.78 crore due to FTII not charging fees for the extended duration of the courses and Rs 9.05 crore due to non-recovery of hostel fees for overstay.FTII's REPLY Responding to the CAG's findings, the FTII, in a reply on September 2016, admitted that there was a problem of students not completing their course work on time and that the institution does not have a set system of dealing with such situations.The CAG report, however, noted that the FTII students' hand book states that a student has to leave the hostel room and campus after completion of the academic tenure of his/her course.CASCADING EFFECTApart from causing a revenue loss, students overstaying at FTII has also had a cascading effect on fresh admissions, the CAG said.Hence, the students continued to be on academic roll and in hostels without payment of fees/hostel charges beyond the prescribed tenure of their courses.3.""Forgoing the admission process in an academic year defeated the purpose of setting up such a premier film and television institute and had incurred a potential revenue loss upto Rs 4.57 crore,"" the report said.ALSO READ | Food served by Indian Railways not fit for human consumption: CAGALSO READ | Textile industry has suffered loss of Rs 40,000 crore due to protests against GST, claim traders   Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.Continuance of a very large number of enrolled students creates additional pressure on the academic and other infrastructure of the institute.4."
124,"Insurance giant Swiss Re is preparing an insurance policy for the Mesoamerican Reef in Mexico to prevent its further deterioration, reports said. Under the scheme, which is reportedly the first for a natural structure, the premiums will be paid by hotels and government, and money to pay for the repair of the reef will be released if a storm strikes.n","Hotels and local government in Cancún will pay premiums, and insurance industry will pay out if the reef is damaged by storms Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent  Thu 20 Jul 2017 11.25 EDT   First published on Thu 20 Jul 2017 10.30 EDT  A stretch of coral reef off Mexico is the testing ground for a new idea that could protect fragile environments around the world: insurance.The reef, off the coast of Cancún, is the first to be protected under an insurance scheme by which the premiums will be paid by local hotels and government, and money to pay for the repair of the reef will be released if a storm strikes.Coral reefs offer a valuable buffer against storm damage from waves but their condition has deteriorated in recent years, the result of human exploitation and destruction of the reefs, as well as climate change, plastic waste and the acidification of the oceans.Under the Cancún insurance policy, pioneered by the insurance company Swiss Re and the Nature Conservancy, a US environmental charity, local organisations dependent on tourism will pay in to a collective pot likely to amount to between $1m (£770,000) and $7.5m for the insurance premiums on the policy, and a 40 mile (60km) stretch of reef and connected beach will be monitored.Their health or decline is seen as one of the key indicators of the state of the natural environment globally.The Cancún scheme, which is to be run by Swiss Re and the Nature Conservancy, with backing from the Mexican government, is thought to be one of the first in the world to tie environmental benefits and the “eco-system services” provided by natural environmental features to firm monetary costs and rewards.It could provide a model for similar projects in the future, linking the protection and preservation of the environment to payouts in case of disaster.Hotels and private companies are signing up to the scheme at present, and the plan is for a fund backed by the government that will cover the premiums.If any destructive storms damage the reef system, the insurer will pay out sums likely to be $25m to $70m in any given year.Any payouts will be used for restoration of the reef, for instance by building artificial structures that can increase the height of the reef in case of storm damage.Corals from the reef can be removed and rested for a period of weeks or months, to help them regrow, at which point they can be safely reattached to their native habitat to regenerate the growth of the reef system.“We have to push business leaders to go further, to stick their neck out to tackle issues beyond the short term.”Tercek said the Cancún scheme would provide an example for businesses, governments and insurance firms that would be “very scalable around the world”.A future target for similar insurance products could be mangrove swamps, which also protect the shore against storm damage, and are equally under threat, with many destroyed to make way for housing development or farming, and others in peril from climate change."

241,"Sumo wrestler Kisenosato became the first Japanese wrestler to be titled 'yokozuna', the sport's grand champion, in almost 18 years. The 30-year-old, who weighs 178 kilograms, became the sport's 72nd yokozuna and Japan's first after Wakanohana, who won the title in 1998. The sport had seen foreign sumo wrestlers getting crowned grand champions for the past few years.","“I have nothing but gratitude.”Kisenosato’s ascent to sumo’s summit did not come easily: his historic victory on Sunday came at the end of his 73rd tournament as a professional, which is more than it has taken any other wrestler since 1926 to reach the top rank.His addition to the yokozuna ranks is also expected to help improve sumo’s image, after a decade in which it has been rocked by a series of scandals, including bullying, drug taking and allegations of match fixing.Kisenosato joins three other wrestlers at the rank of yokozuna, all of whom were born in Mongolia: Kakuryu, Harumafuji and Hakuho.‘With great humility’, wrestler Kisenosato accepts highest rank of yokozuna in sport that had become dominated by other nationalities Justin McCurry in Tokyo  Tue 24 Jan 2017 23.22 EST   Last modified on Tue 28 Nov 2017 01.51 EST  Japan’s long wait for a homegrown sumo grand champion has ended after Kisenosato became the first Japanese wrestler to reach the ancient sport’s pinnacle in almost two decades.The 30-year-old became the sport’s 72nd yokozuna, or grand champion, after Japan’s sumo association approved his promotion on Wednesday in a move purists hope will mark the start of a challenge to years of dominance by overseas wrestlers.The last Japan-born wrestler to reach the top rank was Wakanohana in 1998.The 178kg Kisenosato – who has been criticised for letting several tournament titles slip through his hands – became a serious contender for promotion after winning the new year’s contest in Tokyo with a record of 14 victories and one defeat.At a ceremony at his stable on Wednesday morning, Kisenosato said he accepted his promotion “with great humility”.He added: “I will show devotion and try not to disgrace the title of yokozuna.”In recent years sumo has been dominated by wrestlers from Mongolia, Hawaii and Samoa.Earlier this week, with his promotion all but a formality, Kisenosato told reporters that the rank of yokozuna came with a special responsibility.The latter is considered by many to be the greatest sumo wrestler of all time with 37 tournament titles.Foreign-born wrestlers’ domination of sumo began with the 287kg Konishiki in the 1990s and continued into the next decade with the arrival of Asashoryu from Mongolia whose unpredictable behaviour outside the ring occasionally took the sheen off his brilliant performances inside it.“I feel grateful to all the people that have helped me,” said Kisenosato, who paid tribute to his late stable master, Naruto."
242,"""The editor of British Vogue Alexandra Shulman will be stepping down from her post after over twenty-five years, as announced by the magazine's publisher Cond� Nast. Cond� Nast managing director Nicholas Coleridge, said: """"Alex has been the longest-serving and most successful editor of Vogue in its 100 years history."""" Shulman said that she """"wanted to experience a different life"""".""","Having been editor-in-chief for 25 years, Shulman is moving on as publisher Condé Nast makes other managerial changes Jane Martinson  Wed 25 Jan 2017 14.50 EST   First published on Wed 25 Jan 2017 07.18 EST  It was a departure that one of her colleagues described as “rather stylish”, coming exactly 25 years and a day since Alexandra Shulman’s appointment as editor of British Vogue – and a century after the fashion bible was founded.With both a style and magazine described as a “very British”, Shulman’s departure also marks the end of a rivalry much-loved by fashion journalists between her and the equally British Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of US Vogue and said to be the model for the terrifying Meryl Streep character in The Devil Wears Prada.In departing, Shulman indicated that recent ventures beyond the magazine – a behind-the-scenes BBC documentary, Absolutely Fashion, and a well-received book, Inside Vogue: A Diary of My 100th Year – had made her realise there was a life beyond a magazine she had edited since the age of 34.“I realised that I very much wanted to experience a different life and look forward to a future separate to Vogue,” she said.During Shulman’s tenure at Vogue – circulation has increased 12% to 195,053 in the past 25 years – she has championed both British fashion and London fashion week, now one of the “big four” fashion events.She has a reputation for supporting British designers without quite fitting the image of a perfectly stylish fashion editor.Her first journalistic job was at Tatler, also part of Condé Nast and which had also employed her brother as art director.Within eight years she was editing men’s magazine GQ, where she increased sales by 30%, and two years after that she was made editor of Vogue.Her mother, Drusilla Beyfus, was Vogue associate editor in the 70s while her father, Milton Shulman, had been Vogue film critic, prompting Coleridge to say that Vogue was “almost in her blood” when she was appointed.Despite this, she has always told interviewers that having two parents who were journalists meant she had “wanted to be a hairdresser”, or a musician.In 2015 she wrote about how glad she was to return to work when her only son, now 21 and a history of art student, was 15 weeks old.Although she has refused to publish articles lauding diets or cosmetic surgery, Vogue has been no stranger to controversy.While other international Vogue editors such as Wintour in the US and Carine Roitfeld in France are considered icy style icons, Shulman laughingly told the Guardian of being presented in one feature as the “chain-smoking 50-year-old Toyota-driving divorcee”.When she was appointed it was suggested that she “could become better acquainted with a hairbrush”, according to the New York Times.In the early 1990s a Kate Moss shoot was criticised for encouraging “heroin chic” and in 1997, the watchmaker Omega pulled an ad campaign because of the issue.Early on, Shulman appeared to dismiss these complaints by saying “Not many people have actually said to me that they have looked at my magazine and decided to become anorexic.”But in 2009, she wrote a letter to major international fashion houses complaining that their “minuscule” sample sizes were forcing fashion editors to use models with “jutting bones”.Her January 2017 issue featured a plus-size model, Ashley Graham, on the cover.On the weight issue, she said: “What is an issue is to try to make young women feel more comfortable with how they look in general and not feel they have to look a cookie-cutter way to be a success in life."

247,"The British government must hold a vote in both houses of the Parliament before starting the process of leaving the European Union, the country's Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday. UK Prime Minister Theresa May had earlier promised lawmakers a vote on the outcome of the Brexit talks, but had hoped to trigger the talks without parliamentary approval.","Rights embedded in the law by the 1972 European Communities Act, which took the UK into what was then the European Community, cannot be removed by the government’s prerogative powers, a majority of the justices declared.The eagerly awaited ruling by the largest panel of judges ever assembled in Britain’s highest court routes the protracted Brexit process through parliament, handing over to MPs and peers the authority to sanction the UK’s withdrawal.The supreme court ruled that there was no need for the government to wait for consent from the devolved assemblies in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.Relations with the EU are a matter for the UK government.“The Sewel convention plays an important role in the operation of the UK constitution but the policing of its scope and operation is not a matter for the courts.”Paragraph 122 of the 96-page long judgment makes clear that it is up to MPs and peers to decide what form the bill put before parliament should take.The government has been clear that it will respect the decision of the court.” The president of the supreme court, Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury, delivered a summary of the decision, which has far-reaching constitutional implications.Reading the summary, Neuberger said: “By a majority of eight to three, the supreme court rules that the government cannot trigger article 50 without an act of parliament authorising it to do so.“Section 2 of the 1972 [European Communities] Act provides that, whenever EU institutions make new laws, those new laws become part of UK law.The devolved assemblies in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff had argued for a say on the basis of the Sewel convention, which provides for them to be consulted on matters that are “normally” devolved, but they did not win any formal right to participate in the Brexit process.Neuberger said: “On the devolution issues, the court unanimously rules that UK ministers are not legally compelled to consult the devolved legislatures before triggering article 50.Therefore, the government cannot trigger article 50 without parliament authorising that course.”Neuberger said: “Any change in the law to give effect to the referendum must be made in the only way permitted by the UK constitution, namely by an act of parliament."

their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.That all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America."

Jeff Bezos: the founder of Amazon; Mark Zuckerberg: the founder of Facebook; Larry Ellison, chief executive of US tech firm Oracle; and Michael Bloomberg; a former mayor of New York and founder and owner of the Bloomberg news and financial information service.Last year, Oxfam said the world’s 62 richest billionaires were as wealthy as half the world’s population.It was four years since the WEF had first identified inequality as a threat to social stability, but that the gap between rich and poor has continued to widen, Oxfam added.“From Brexit to the success of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, a worrying rise in racism and the widespread disillusionment with mainstream politics, there are increasing signs that more and more people in rich countries are no longer willing to tolerate the status quo,” the report said.The charity said new information had shown that poor people in China and India owned even fewer assets than previously thought, making the wealth gap more pronounced than it thought a year ago, when it announced that 62 billionaires owned the same wealth as the poorest half of the global population.Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, said: “This year’s snapshot of inequality is clearer, more accurate and more shocking than ever before.The body that organises the Davos event said rising inequality was not an “iron law of capitalism”, but a matter of making the right policy choices.The WEF report found that 51% of the 103 countries for which data was available saw their inclusive development index scores decline over the past five years, “attesting to the legitimacy of public concern and the challenge facing policymakers regarding the difficulty of translating economic growth into broad social progress”.Basing its research on the Forbes rich list and data provided by investment bank Credit Suisse, Oxfam said the vast majority of people in the bottom half of the world’s population were facing a daily struggle to survive, with 70% of them living in low-income countries.However, the number has dropped to eight in 2017 because new information shows that poverty in China and India is worse than previously thought, making the bottom 50% even worse off and widening the gap between rich and poor.With members of the forum due to arrive on Monday in Switzerland, where guests will range from the Chinese president Xi Jinping, to pop star Shakira, the WEF released its own inclusive growth and development report in which it said median income had fallen by an average of 2.4% between 2008 and 2013 across 26 advanced nations.Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Iceland and Denmark filled the top five places in the WEF’s inclusive development index, with Britain 21st and the US 23rd.The fact that a super-rich elite are able to prosper at the expense of the rest of us at home and overseas shows how warped our economy has become.”Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, said: “Once again Oxfam have come out with a report that demonises capitalism, conveniently skimming over the fact that free markets have helped over 100 million people rise out of poverty in the last year alone.”The Oxfam report added that since 2015 the richest 1% has owned more wealth than the rest of the planet."

Mammals with an appendix were found to have higher concentrations of lymphoid tissue in the cecum, a pouch from which the appendix develops, suggesting that appendix serves as a secondary immune organ.","Jump to navigationSpeak NowWashington, Jan 10 (PTI) The human appendix, which is thought to be of little use to the body, may actually serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria, a new study has found.The appendix, a narrow pouch that projects off the cecum in the digestive system, has a notorious reputation for its tendency to become inflamed (appendicitis), often resulting in surgical removal.Although it is widely viewed as a vestigial organ with little known function, the new study suggests that the appendix may serve an important purpose.In particular, it may serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria.Several other mammal species also have an appendix and studying how it evolved and functions in these species may shed light on this mysterious organ in humans.Researchers from the Midwestern University Arizona College of Osteopathic Medicine in the US gathered data on the presence or absence of the appendix and other gastrointestinal and environmental traits for 533 mammal species.They mapped the data onto a phylogeny (genetic tree) to track how the appendix has evolved through mammalian evolution, and to try to determine why some species have an appendix while others do not.They discovered that the appendix has evolved independently in several mammal lineages, over 30 separate times, and almost never disappears from a lineage once it has appeared.For reprint rights: Syndications TodayCopyright © 2020 Living Media India Limited.As Covid-19 cases surge in India, is the nation prepared to deal with pandemic?This suggests that the appendix likely serves an adaptive purpose.Looking at ecological factors, such as diet, climate, how social a species is, and where it lives, they were able to reject several previously proposed hypotheses that have attempted to link the appendix to dietary or environmental factors.Instead, they found that species with an appendix have higher average concentrations of lymphoid (immune) tissue in the cecum.This finding suggests that the appendix may play an important role as a secondary immune organ.Lymphatic tissue can also stimulate growth of some types of beneficial gut bacteria, providing further evidence that the appendix may serve as a ""safe house"" for helpful gut bacteria.They also found that animals with certain shaped ceca (tapering or spiral-shaped) were more likely to have an appendix than animals with a round or cylindrical cecum.Therefore, they concluded that the appendix is not evolving independently, but as part of a larger ""cecoappendicular complex"" including both the appendix and cecum.You rare man Importance of being Rahul Gandhi in the time of Modi Coronavirus in India: Cases cross 56,000-mark, death toll reaches 1,886 Migrants crushed to death by goods train in Aurangabad Air India flights carrying Indians from UAE land in Kerala Good news: Meet Mumbai's trio who donate masks to needy Is Bengal govt in denial over Covid-19 numbers?"

Nitrogen oxide emissions per kilometre for diesel cars were found to be double that of heavy-duty vehicles. Diesel cars emit about six times more toxic gases than allowed, the study claimed.","However, the buses and trucks have larger engines and burn more diesel per kilometre, meaning that cars produce 10 times more NOx per litre of fuel.The ICCT analysis showed that manufacturers were able to ensure that heavy duty vehicles kept below pollution limits when on the road, but that emissions from cars soar once in the real world.Official EU tests for cars are currently limited to laboratory measurements of prototype vehicles.Following the Volkswagen “dieselgate” scandal, the car tests are due to be toughened, but campaigners say the reforms do not go far enough.The new report from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), a research group that played a key role in exposing Volkswagen’s cheating, compared the emissions from trucks and buses in realistic driving conditions with those of cars.It found that heavy-duty vehicles tested in Germany and Finland emitted about 210mg NOx per kilometre driven, less than half the 500mg/km pumped out by modern diesel cars that meet the highest “Euro 6” standard.Stricter EU emissions testing for large vehicles means modern diesel cars produce 10 times more NOx per litre of fuel Damian Carrington  Fri 6 Jan 2017 01.01 EST   Last modified on Wed 14 Feb 2018 11.37 EST  Modern diesel cars produce 10 times more toxic air pollution than heavy trucks and buses, new European data has revealed.The stark difference in emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) is due to the much stricter testing applied to large vehicles in the EU, according to the researchers behind a new report.It will also be put forward for discussion by the European commission on 17 January in Brussels, but the ICCT said it faces resistance from some vehicle manufacturers and EU member states.In December, the European commission started legal action against the UK and six other EU states for failing to act against car emissions cheating in the wake of the dieselgate scandal.As a consequence, randomly selected vehicles can be tested under real-world driving conditions,” said Peter Mock, managing director of ICCT in Europe.Changes to the car testing regime in the EU are due to start in September, with mobile devices, called portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS), attached to vehicles as they drive on real roads."

However, the Rajasthan High Court struck down the move.","After the Rajasthan High Court struck down the move to bring five castes, including Gujjars, under the Special Backward Castes (SBC) category, the Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakashan Sangharsh Samiti has begun to demand that a separate reservation of 5 per cent be created for the nomadic castes within the Other Backward Classes (OBC), thus abiding with the total cap of 50 per cent on reservation.This, the agitating Gujjars feel, can help avoid the court's scrutiny.The Rajasthan government had, through a Bill in September, 2015, provided 5 per cent reservation for 5 castes under the Special Backward Classes (SBC), thus taking the total reservation in Rajasthan to 54 per cent.After that, representatives of the Sangharsh Samiti were called in for a dialogue.As per Himmat Singh Gujjar, spokesperson for Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (RGASS), the government during the dialogue that happened following the May agitation had promised that changes would be made in the 9th Schedule of the Constitution at the Central level, thus fulfilling the government's promise on the issue of reservation.Also read | Rajasthan: Gujjars launch fresh stir demanding quota in government jobsHe claimed, ""Now our demand is for 5 per cent reservation to be set aside for the 5 castes within the OBC category.That included 21 per cent for OBCs, 16 per cent for Scheduled Castes and 12 per cent for Scheduled Tribes.Also read | Raj Govt tries to assure Gujjars on quota after stir threatThe High Court had mentioned that five castes (Gujjars, Banjaras, Gadarias, Raikas and Gadia Lohars), previously falling in the category of OBCs and getting benefits of reservation, have been brought under SBCs to provide five per cent reservation, exceeding the ceiling of 50 per cent.The court observed that the SBC Commission and the state government had failed to discharge their obligation, as per the directions of the apex court, to collect quantifiable data.The court, citing the Supreme Court's 9-judge bench Indira Sahani judgement, stated that there were no special reasons for creating a separate 5 per cent reservation pool for these castes.Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakashan Sangharsh Samiti has begun to demand that a separate reservation of 5 per cent be created for the nomadic castes within the OBC quota, thus abiding with the total cap of 50 per cent on reservation.The Gujjars demand for reservation in Rajasthan can fast become an albatross around Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje's neck.Earlier, even in 2013, the court had come down heavily on the move to create a separate category for the Gujjars and other castes that took the total percentage beyond 50.The issue of Gujjar reservation has been a sensitive one in Rajasthan."

Meanwhile, Hindus and Muslims have the fewest years of formal schooling, with an average of 5.6 years. Notably, adults with no religious affiliation spend 8.8 years in school on average.","Pew report on schooling of different faiths finds disparity between religions in some areas of world such as sub-Saharan Africa Harriet Sherwood Religion correspondent  Tue 13 Dec 2016 10.00 EST   Last modified on Tue 28 Nov 2017 04.36 EST  Jews are better educated than any other major religious group in the world, with an average of 13.4 years of schooling and a majority going on to higher education, a study has found.At the other end of the educational scale, Hindus and Muslims have the fewest years of formal schooling, with an average of 5.6 years.The main reason for the disparity is that Jews are largely concentrated in Israel and the US, countries with high levels of education generally, whereas 98% of the world’s Hindus live in the developing countries of India, Nepal and Bangladesh.Among Muslims, those that live in countries with strong economies are well-educated, but those who live in developing regions have comparatively short periods of formal schooling – and girls fare worse than boys.But there are also notable differences between religious groups in the same areas of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where Christians are generally better educated than Muslims.The study, Religion and Education Around the World, was published on Tuesday by the Washington-based Pew Research Center.It found that, compared with the Jewish average of more than 13 years of formal schooling, Christians had 9.3 years, Buddhists 7.9, and Muslims and Hindus 5.6.Although overall a much higher proportion of women had received no formal education, and those that had generally spent fewer years in school, the gap was shrinking with successive generations.But among Hindus, there was still an 18-point gap between the youngest men and women, with 38% of women having no formal education compared with 20% of men.The gender gap among the youngest Muslims was 10 points, with 33% of women not going to school compared with 23% of men.The religiously unaffiliated had closed the gap within three generations, although there were still 2% of men and women having no formal education.In higher education, Jews strikingly reversed the gender gap.Among the factors affecting education levels are socioeconomic conditions, armed conflict, child labour and child marriage.Christians in Europe and North America tend to be much more highly educated than those in sub-Saharan Africa.Hindus have relatively low levels of education in India, Bangladesh and Nepal – but in the US, 96% have college degrees, a higher share than any other major religious group.In general, religious minorities in the US are more likely to have college degrees than the Christian majority (Hindus 96%, Jews 75%, Muslims 54%, Buddhists 53%, unaffiliated 44%, Christians 36%).In sub-Saharan Africa, Muslims are more than twice as likely as Christians to have no formal schooling – and the gap is widening.The report says: “Some scholars suggest that the source of the Christian-Muslim attainment gap is rooted in the location of Christian missionary activity during colonial times.Adults with no religious affiliation spend 8.8 years in school on average.Almost one in five of all adults – more than 680 million people – received no formal schooling, but for Muslims and Hindus, the number missing out on education rose to around two in five.However, in recent years the amount of time spent at school has increased among all groups.According to Pew, the youngest Hindus in the study (born between 1976 and 1985) spent an average of 7.1 years in school – nearly twice as long as the oldest Hindus (born between 1936 and 1955).Within three generations, Muslims, similarly, were spending an extra three years at school, with an extra 2.5 years for Buddhists.Over the same period, Christians gained just an extra year and Jews less than half a year.Among religiously unaffiliated adults, the youngest had an extra 2.9 years in school, overtaking Christians for the number of school years for this age group.Pew found similar changes when looking at the educational gender gap."

The offer by Jae-in, who has vowed to achieve peace with North Korea, comes after the reclusive state claimed to have test-fired its first intercontinental ballistic missile.","[NEW]The European Union offered European support for South Korean efforts to negotiate with North Korea, but said it was also considering tougher sanctions on Pyongyang following its first intercontinental ballistic missile test.In a statement Monday, the EU’s executive arm condemned the test earlier this month as a “serious threat to international peace and security” and urged an end to such actions.The latest missile test – which Kim described as a “gift” to the Americans – was seen as a milestone in Pyongyang’s quest to build a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead that can hit the US mainland.The proposed meetings, if realised, would be a “rare opportunity to ease tension that has built up for 10 years”, said Cheong Seong-chang, analyst at the Sejong Institute, a thinktank.“It would at least help let off some steam out of the current crisis, although the North would still maintain that it would not give up its weapons programmes,” he said.Seoul’s defence ministry wants to reboot moribund diplomacy as Red Cross renews attempts to reunite Korean familiesAgence France-Presse in Seoul  Mon 17 Jul 2017 03.08 EDT   Last modified on Mon 27 Nov 2017 15.02 EST  South Korea has offered to hold rare military talks with the North to ease tensions after Pyongyang’s first intercontinental ballistic missile test earlier this month.Monday’s offer, the first since South Korea elected the moderate Moon Jae-In as president, came as the Red Cross in Seoul proposed a separate meeting to discuss the reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean war.The South’s defence ministry proposed a meeting on Friday at the border truce village of Panmunjom, while the Red Cross offered to hold talks on 1 August at the same venue.If the government meeting goes ahead, it will be the first official inter-Korea talks since December 2015.Moon’s conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye, had refused to engage in substantive dialogue with Pyongyang unless the isolated regime made a tangible commitment to denuclearisation.The Red Cross said it hoped for a positive response from its counterpart in the North; mooted family reunions in early October would be the first in two years.Millions of families were separated by the conflict that sealed the division of the peninsula.Moon, who took power in May, has advocated dialogue with the nuclear-armed North as a means of bringing it to the negotiating table and vowed to play a more active role in global efforts to tame the South’s unpredictable neighbour.But Pyongyang has staged a series of missile launches in violation of UN resolutions, most recently on 4 July when it test-fired its first ICBM, a move which triggered global alarm and a push by the US president, Donald Trump, to impose harsher UN sanctions on the country.Washington has also called on China, the North’s sole ally, to put more pressure on Pyongyang to rein in its nuclear ambitions, which have advanced rapidly under the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un.“North Korea should respond to our sincere proposals if it really seeks peace on the Korean Peninsula,” said Cho Myoung-gyon, Seoul’s unification minister in charge of North Korea affairs.Cho stressed that Seoul “would not seek collapse of the North or unification through absorbing the North” and urged Pyongyang to restore inter-Korea communication channels, including a shuttered military hotline."
462,"""Donald Trump's six-month approval rating stands at 36%, the lowest among all US Presidents in the last 70 years, according to a national poll published on Sunday. The poll found that 48% of US citizens believe that the country's leadership in the world is weaker than before the billionaire took office. However, Trump called the poll result """"not bad"""".""","On Sunday morning he used Twitter to claim, incorrectly, that “almost 40% [approval] is not bad at this time” and that the poll in question had been “just about the most inaccurate around election time!”.In fact, the Washington Post/ABC poll came close to predicting the popular vote on election day – which Hillary Clinton won by 2.5m ballots, Trump taking the White House in the electoral college – and no president has suffered such low ratings at this early stage in their tenure since such polling began in 1945.The poll also found that 63% of people thought the June 2016 meeting between senior members of Trump’s inner circle, including Donald Trump Jr and son-in-law Jared Kushner, and a group of Russians including the lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, was inappropriate.On Saturday, a campaign finance report filed to the Federal Election Commission revealed that Trump’s campaign committee had paid $50,000 to Trump Jr’s lawyer Alan Futerfas on 27 June, 13 days before the New York Times revealed the meeting had taken place.“The president had secret service protection at that point, and that raised a question with me.”A spokesman for the secret service later confirmed that Trump Jr was not under the agency’s protection at the time of the meeting and “thus we would not have screened anyone he was meeting with”.Under pressure from the New York Times, Trump Jr this week released damning emails revealing he eagerly embraced what he was told was a Russian government attempt to damage the Clinton campaign.The emails show music promoter Rob Goldstone telling the future president’s son that “the crown prosecutor of Russia” had offered “to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father”.The New York Times reported that Trump signed off on his son’s first statement to the Times about the meeting, which like subsequent statements was soon revealed not to be a full account of events.Kushner, Trump’s senior adviser, and then campaign manager Paul Manafort also attended the meeting.It was a short meeting, as he told me – because I only heard about it two or three days ago.”The Trump campaign committee’s finance filing also shows it paid $89,000 to the Trump Corporation, which is led by Trump Jr and his brother, Eric, for “legal consulting”.It was announced on Saturday that Trump had hired Washington attorney Ty Cobb to serve as his special counsel regarding the Russia investigations being run by the Senate judiciary and intelligence committees and special counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director appointed after Trump fired his successor James Comey in May.The move seemingly reflects the president’s growing acceptance that the investigations will linger over his tenure for months or even years.On Sunday morning, he also tweeted: “Thank you to all of the supporters, who far out-numbered the protesters, yesterday at the Women’s US Open.It was revealed on Friday that Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian American lobbyist and former Soviet military officer, was present as well.Earlier on Sunday morning, Trump tweeted more outspoken support for his eldest son.“Hillary Clinton can illegally get the questions to the debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?” the president wrote.Trump has previously described the political storm over his son’s meeting as “the greatest witch-hunt in political history” and “sad!” and said anyone would have taken the meeting as offered.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Thursday, the president said 39-year-old Trump Jr was “a good boy” and added: “And he had a meeting, nothing happened with the meeting.Trump himself told reporters on Wednesday he had only been made aware of the 2016 meeting, which occurred in Trump Tower, “two or three days ago” – raising the prospect that his campaign committee could have known about the contact before the president did."

477,"Stanford researchers have found an abundance of marine life at Bikini Atoll island, which was declared a nuclear wasteland after the US tested 23 bombs between 1946-1958, including one 1,100 times larger than the Hiroshima atom bomb. The team discovered a diverse ecosystem thriving in the crater with corals and fish, and crabs devouring radioactive coconuts on the shore.","A team of scientists from Stanford University have been surprised to discover an abundance of marine life apparently thriving in the crater of Bikini Atoll, which was declared a nuclear wasteland after the bombings, with its 167 inhabitants relocated to other islands.Steve Palumbi, a professor in marine sciences at the university, said the effects of radiation poisoning on ocean life have never been studied in-depth, and his team’s initial research suggests it is “remarkably resilient”.Palumbi said to the naked eye the crabs, fish and coral of Bikini Atoll look perfectly normal and healthy, and some of the coral has been around for decades – with evidence it may have begun growing as soon as 10 years after the last bombs were dropped.“The lagoon is full of schools of fish all swirling around the living coral.It is a remarkable environment, quite odd.” Palumbi’s team concentrated their research efforts on the coral and coconut crabs – which are the size of hub caps – because they have long-life spans, allowing the scientists to delve into what effect the radiation exposure has had on the animals DNA after building up in their systems for many years.Because fish have relatively short life-spans it is possible the worst-affected fish died off many decades ago, said Palumbi, and the fish living in Bikini Atoll today are only subject to low-levels of radiation exposure as they frequently swim in and out of the atoll.“The fact there is life there and the life there is trying to come back from the most violent thing we’ve ever done to it is pretty hopeful.”Even though plant, animal and ocean life is showing strong signs of recovery, humans are still unable to live and work on the atoll, besides a few caretakers who bring food and water supplies with them, and keep up the islands facilities."

The bodies are the evidence of extrajudicial executions of ISIS militants by the Iraqi security forces, non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch has alleged. Soldiers have shifted the corpses to a morgue at the city's general hospital.","None had been claimed, and even that toll of the unknown dead is not exhaustive; some bodies are lost.“(Once) the body of a boy also floated by but we could not catch it as it was too small and went through the gaps in the barrier,” said the driver Mohammed, who is haunted by guilt at letting the young boy drift away.Human rights organisations had raised alarm about the number of unsolved killings in and around Mosul city and in particular the corpses washing up along the Tigris river.“We don’t know where they come from, they are unidentified,” he said.Some in the town say the bodies are more Isis victims killed by the last fighters holed up in Mosul, but the Iraqi security forces had blocked the river around 20km outside the city with a floating boom designed to stop fighters sneaking out or reinforcements getting in by water.He is described by one as “The child of adultery, Ali Khether, the Daeshi” – a name that refers to Daesh, a pejorative name for Isis.Close by stands the town’s small stadium where Isis, with the aid of local people, killed dozens, with the most cursory of trials, on charges ranging from spying for the security services to homosexualityNow as Isis retreats to the Syrian city of Raqqa and desert areas of western Iraq, those who were on the receiving end of their brutality for over two years have set up their own militia groups.Loosely attached to the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU), they are taking the law into their own hands.“PMU militias have carried out a systematic pattern of violations, including enforced disappearance, extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings and torture of Sunni Arab men and boys, seemingly in revenge for IS attacks,” said Amnesty International in a report earlier this year.Security forces who retook the town found the bodies of many Isis victims that had been dumped in the river, said Walid Khaled an officer at Qayyarah police station, but he had no idea who the more recent waves of dead might be.Territory further down river towards Qayyarah has been in the control of Iraqi security forces for months.A soldier guarding a floating bridge connecting Munirah village, around 20km south of Mosul on the western bank, refused to give his name, but appeared to confirm that extrajudicial killings were taking place beside the river.He showed the Guardian a video of himself and other soldiers, dragging a limp body with a bloody face along the edge of the water."

The country produced an estimated 866 tonnes of cocaine in 2016 as compared to 649 tonnes in 2015. Coca crops, the raw material used for cocaine, covered 146,000 hectares in 2016, up 52% from 96,000 in 2015.","During much of the group’s 53 years as an armed insurgency, it financed its fight through the drug trade.Former combatants have committed to work with the government to convince farmers to replace coca crops with another way to make a living.“The history of drug crops is divided in two: before and after the beginning of the post-conflict period,” said Enrique Gil Botero, the justice minister.Already 40% of the goal of forced eradication has been met, and 86,000 families – who account for as much as 76,000 hectares of coca – have signed on to crop substitution programs in exchange for subsidies of about $11,000 per farmer over the course of two years, according to the government.“Having the Farc on the side of substitution and not on the other side makes a difference,” said Rodrigo Pardo, who heads the government agency in charge of implementing the peace agreement.But the deal on crop substitution with the Farc, announced before the final peace deal was finalized last year, also provided a perverse incentive for farmers to grow coca, knowing they would later be awarded subsidies.Higher yields from mature plants mean more cocaine can be produced per hectare planted.The results of the study “show a complex panorama”, said Bo Mathiasen, the UNODC’s representative in Colombia.José Ángel Mendoza, the head of Colombia’s counter-narcotics police, said Colombia faced “a difficult historical moment”, but stressed that the figures reflected the state of the country on 31 December 2016.Since then, the government has put in place an ambitious plan to eradicate 100,000 hectares of coca by the year’s end.While calculating 180,000 hectares of coca, the US figured the country produced about 700 tonnes of the drug in 2016.Sibylla Brodzinsky in Bogotá  Fri 14 Jul 2017 17.46 EDT   Last modified on Tue 26 Mar 2019 11.11 EDT  Colombia has spent years trying to shake off its reputation as the cocaine capital of the world, but the country is producing more of the drug than ever before, according to new figures from the United Nations.An estimated 866 tonnes of cocaine were produced at clandestine labs across the country in 2016, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).In 2015, the estimate was 649.In terms of the area planted with coca, the raw material used for cocaine, Colombia is back at the same levels as in 2001, when a huge US-backed anti-narcotics effort known as Plan Colombia was just getting under way."

487,"Islam's third holiest site, the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, will be closed for Friday prayers for the first time in 17 years. This comes after three attackers killed two Israeli police officers near the mosque complex earlier in the day. All the three gunmen were killed and the area was cleared of visitors and closed, police officials said.","The two dead police officers were named as Hael Sathawi, 30, and Kamil Shnan, 22.According to police, the three men – residents of the Israeli Arab town of Umm al-Fahm who were armed with home-made Carlo machine guns and a pistol – opened fire on police near the gate before fleeing back into the heart of the compound which houses the al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock.Israel’s Shin Bet security service later named the three attackers as Mohammed Ahmed Mohammed Jabareen, 29, Mohammed Hamed Abd Al-Latif Jabareen, 19, and Mohammed Ahmed Mafdal Jabareen, also 19, noting that none had previous security convictions.Police security camera footage, released late on Friday, showed the gunmen approaching two policemen at the gate from within the compound - raising questions about how their weapons were smuggled onto the site.Two men with guns can be seen emerging through the low arched entrance and almost immediately shooting one of the policemen from behind as he is talking to his seated colleague.As other Israeli police pursued the men, a heavy exchange of gunfire took place, startling early-morning worshippers in the central plaza, some of whom recorded the shootout on camera phones.In the immediate aftermath the compound was cleared of visitors and closed, with police announcing that Muslim Friday prayers, usually attended by thousands, would be cancelled for the first time in 17 years.Israel said the site would remain closed until Sunday at the earliest while it continued with security assessments despite calls for it to be reopened.The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, condemned the attack in a rare phone call to the Israeli president, Benjamin Netanyahu, according to the Palestinian Wafa news agency.Video footage recorded during the attack showed shooting and police running across the central plaza in pursuit of the attackers.At one point, one of the gunmen, who is seen lying on the ground apparently motionless, is seen jumping up, amid a fresh exchange of fire in which he falls.A police spokesman described the beginning of the incident.“When they saw policemen they shot towards them and then escaped towards one of the mosques in the Temple Mount compound,” said Luba Samri.It began near the Lions’ Gate entrance to the compound, which is revered as a holy site by both Muslims and Jews.A few hours after the incident, the chief of the Israeli police, Roni Alsheich, confirmed the death of the two male officers from wounds sustained in the attack.The incident was among the most serious in Jerusalem in recent years and threatened to raise Israeli-Palestinian tensions.Netanyahu said in the aftermath of the attack that he would not change prayer rights at the site, despite calls by far-right politicians who sought to exploit the shooting.The deputy defence minister, Eli Ben-Dahan of the far-right Jewish Home party, had called for Israel to “bolster its rule and control over the [holy sites], and to ensure that all Jews can pray there at any time in safety”.The occupation preventing us from praying marks an assault against our right to worship in this pure Islamic mosque,” he said.The incident follows a reported move by the Israeli government to allow Israeli MPs, who are not allowed to go to the flashpoint site, to visit the Temple Mount on a trial basis.Israel’s public security minister, Gilad Erdan, said: “The terror attack today is a severe and dire event in which all red lines have been crossed.A gun used in one recent attack had a barrel made from water piping while the moving parts are often mounted on already available stocks, including from paintball guns.While unreliable and inaccurate, the guns are much cheaper than black market weapons and Israel is increasing its efforts to find and close the workshops where they are made.The al-Aqsa mosque is Islam’s third-holiest site, while the seventh-century Dome of the Rock is also revered by Jews as the site of the historic temple."

493,"The most resilient form of life on Earth, tardigrade, also known as water bear, will survive until the Sun dies, as per an Oxford University research. The eight-legged micro-animal can survive for 30 years without food or water, and endure temperature extremes from -270�C to 150�C. Further, tardigrades can withstand catastrophic events like large asteroid impacts, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts.","Microscopic creatures reassure scientists complete eradication of life on the planet is extremely unlikely Whether it is a supernova or an asteroid impact, should a cosmic calamity strike, it seems there will be at least one form of life left: a tubby, microscopic animal with the appearance of a crumpled hoover bag.The creatures, known as tardigrades, are staggeringly hardy animals, a millimetre or less in size, with species living in wet conditions that range from mountain tops to chilly ocean waters to moss and lichen on land.“They can survive incredible conditions – we are talking close to absolute zero, the vacuum of space, exposure to radiation that would kill us, and these things just walk away from it like nothing happened,” said David Sloan, an astrophysicist from the University of Oxford.Now new research by Sloan and colleagues has shown that the creatures would survive any cosmic disaster that might conceivably be thrown at Earth – a discovery that could have implications elsewhere in the solar system, and beyond.Matthew Cobb, professor of zoology at the University of Manchester, who was not involved in the study said the findings were reassuring for the future of life on Earth.“It suggests that the complete eradication of life on Earth is extremely unlikely until we get to the point that the sun enlarges and all the oceans boil away,” he said.But the team found that the chances of such events were so remote as to be extremely unlikely – there was little chance of a supernova occurring close enough to an Earth-like planet to kill off the creatures, and it would take an impact from an asteroid or dwarf planet near the mass of Vesta for the oceans to boil.“What you then want to ask is if life started on one of these planets, what are the odds that it is still around?”Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, the researchers describe how they probed the conundrum by exploring the likelihood of a variety of catastrophes serious enough to wipe out tardigrades on an Earth-like planet, including a nearby supernova, a burst of gamma-rays, and an impact by a large asteroid powerful enough to cause the oceans to boil away.“And if there was some water left so that the tardigrades could re-animate, if there was no food left they eat algae and fungi - they too would be dead in a couple of weeks.”Cobb, too, noted that even if the tardigrades were the only survivors, they would face a struggle."

499,"""Japanese company Konica Minolta has created a gadget called Kunkun Body that checks users' body odour for ?17,000. It can test for smells near the head, behind ears, under armpits, and around feet and rate them in three levels of severity. For example, on detecting high readings of smells, the gadget's connected smartphone app would display, """"Immediately care is needed.""""""","Now there’s an app for that, too.A Japanese tech company has begun selling a device that allows people to self-test their sweaty exteriors for three categories of smell.The pocket-sized detector, which looks like a tape recorder, connects by Bluetooth to a smartphone app that divulges the potentially ominous results in a suitably discreet manner.Konica Minolta, the firm previously best known for producing cameras and printers, believes there is a market for the odour checker in Japan because people are “particularly sensitive to smell”.There is even a word in Japanese for the behaviour of office workers who annoy others with their noxious aromas – sumehara, or “smell harassment”.At a launch event in Tokyo on Thursday, this reporter discovered the inevitable consequences of walking 30 minutes in the searing summer sun to get to the venue.A check behind the ear revealed fairly high readings of sweat smells and middle-fat odours.“Immediately care is needed,” the app warned in a message on the results page.There was, however, nothing detected in the category kareishū – which translates as old-age smell, commonly associated with the substance 2-nonenal.Daisuke Koda, who is the incubation lead at Konica Minolta Japan’s business innovation centre, said the idea arose after a discussion he had with several male colleagues, all aged about 40, two years ago.They were discussing the increasingly intense summer heat and confided in each other that they sometimes were afraid of how they smelled.“We looked for a device to measure body smell, only to find that there was no device at all to tell the different types of smells,” Koda told the Guardian.“That prompted us to think it might be an opportunity for a new business and we continued our research further deeper.”Studies showed that the number one etiquette concern in the workplace was body smell, Koda added.It can be used to test for smells in four locations: near the head, behind the ear, under the armpit and around the feet.The device is available to Japanese buyers as part of a set of care products in a crowdfunding drive launched on Thursday morning.Owners of the device, dubbed an “aromatic Walkman”, can select which scent they want to be emitted in their vicinity.In a bid to beat the notoriously hot and humid summer conditions, people in Japan often carry around handkerchiefs to wipe away sweat and parasols to block the sun’s rays.In June last year, retailers and manufacturers reported an increase in sales of antiperspirants and wipe products compared to the previous year, according to a report by Jiji Press.Early adopters are offered discounts on the recommended retail price of 30,000 yen (US$265 or £206) with the devices set to be delivered later this year.The company said it had no current plans to sell the device outside Japan.It’s not the first device aimed at addressing smell-related worries in Japan."

540,"""In a company-wide email, Tesla CEO Elon Musk told employees that it's """"obviously not cool"""" when """"someone in a less represented group"""" sues Tesla for millions of dollars because they felt they weren't promoted enough. The email was reportedly sent a few days after Tesla fired a female engineer who accused the automaker of ignoring her sexual harassment complaints. ""","The company said she “falsely attacked” Tesla in the press, amounting to a “miscarriage of justice”, adding: “It is impossible to trust anyone after they have behaved in such a manner.”Her lawyer, Therese Lawless, well known for fighting discrimination in Silicon Valley, said the statement was clear evidence that Tesla’s termination was retaliation for raising concerns about workplace conditions, which is her legally protected right.In addition to saying she was not qualified for her job, Tesla has also repeatedly noted that Vandermeyden did not have an engineering degree, a fact many tech journalists have repeated in articles.Immediately after the meeting, Tesla said it sent a factory-wide message to supervisors about its “strict policy against any kind of harassment”, adding, “Any complaints of catcalling in the factory are thoroughly investigated and action is taken where necessary.”Tesla also said that at the meeting, “there was a lot of energy around ensuring we are proactively sourcing diverse talent and ensuring that we have an interview and assessment process that is free from bias”.Vandermeyden said she talked briefly about her experience at the meeting, adding: “It was finally giving women a venue to voice what was going on.It hurts because there are going to be some people who believe that.”She also noted that she has consistently received positive performance evaluations and called his email “defamatory”.Asked about the email, Tesla said in a statement: “This email in fact did not reference Ms Vandermeyden or her case.”Vandermeyden said she wished that Musk would consider that “dissent isn’t disloyalty” and that her love of Tesla drove her to advocate for better working conditions.You shouldn’t have to have daughters to know this.” She said executives’ responses to questions about diversity were generic and filled with corporate jargon.Tesla said in an email that a Women in Tesla group hosted the event and that “executives attended because they wanted to hear directly from employees about their experiences and learn about how to improve the workplace”.In fact, they both had a positive rapport and expressed mutual support, as Gaby was new to her role at Tesla and was attempting to resolve the matter in a positive and mutually supportive manner for the company and for Ms Vandermeyden.”Vandermeyden struggled to process the news and was further shocked when Tesla released a 430-word statement to the Guardian justifying the termination."

After reports suggested that the hackers may be state-sponsored actors, they left a message offering to decrypt every infected computer for a one-off payment of ?1.7 crore.","It is possible to see the movement of the ransom payments thanks to the public nature of the bitcoin currency: all transfers are recorded on the public blockchain, although the real-world identities of the individuals or organisations behind a particular payment address can be near-impossible to discern.Currently, the blockchain records that the bulk of the ransom money, £7,872 worth of bitcoin, was simply transferred to a second wallet on Tuesday night, but two smaller payments, of £200 each, went to accounts used by two text-sharing websites, Pastebin and DeepPaste.Around 10 minutes before the payments were made, someone made posts on both those sites claiming to be able to decrypt hard disks infected with the malware in exchange for a payment of 100 bitcoins.The £200,000 offer has created more uncertainty about the motivations behind the ransomware.While it originally appeared to be created with the intention of earning a lot of money through ransom payments, researchers quickly pointed out that a number of features of the software made it appear that the ransom element was a smokescreen, with the real goal being widespread damage.Significantly, the majority of infections occurred in Ukraine, due to the main attack vector being a compromised version of an accounting program, ME Doc, used to file taxes in the nation.That has led to many, including the Ukrainian government, suspecting Russian involvement as part of the ongoing cyberwar between the two countries.Hackers offering to decrypt files for money suggests that the cash motivation may be more significant than thought – but that too could be misdirection.While the hackers continue to play games, the Ukrainian cybercrime unit is continuing its investigation.‘NotPetya’ ransomware creators move £8,000 in bitcoin, leaving observers uncertain over the attack’s motive  Alex Hern  Wed 5 Jul 2017 07.02 EDT   Last modified on Wed 5 Jul 2017 10.02 EDT  The hackers behind the NotPetya ransomware, which wiped computers in more than 60 countries in late June, have moved more than £8,000 worth of bitcoins out of the account used to receive the ransoms.The transfer has added credence to messages purporting to be from the attackers offering to decrypt every single infected computer for a one-off payment of £200,000, after security researchers suggested they may be state-sponsored actors.On Wednesday, it announced that it had seized ME Doc’s servers after “new activity” was detected there, and said it had acted to “immediately stop the uncontrolled proliferation” of malware.Cyber police spokeswoman Yulia Kvitko suggested that ME Doc had sent or was preparing to send a new update and added that swift action had prevented any further damage."

Referring to Saudi's purchase of $100-billion worth of US arms during President Donald Trump's recent visit to Riyadh, Salehi said """"lavish arms purchases"""" by regional actors would be seen as provocative in Iran.""","Ali Akbar Salehi, who helped negotiate 2015 deal on Tehran’s atomic programme, says US risks upsetting balance of power in Middle East Comment: ‘US must stop endangering Iran nuclear deal’  Saeed Kamali Dehghan Iran correspondent  Fri 23 Jun 2017 01.00 EDT   Last modified on Thu 5 Jul 2018 16.49 EDT  The head of Iran’s atomic energy organisation, one of the architects of the 2015 landmark nuclear deal, has warned the US to stop upsetting the regional balance of power by siding with Saudi Arabia.Writing in the Guardian, Ali Akbar Salehi said “lavish arms purchases” by regional actors – a reference to the Saudi purchase of $100bn of US arms during Donald Trump’s recent visit to Riyadh – would be seen as provocative in Tehran and that it would be unrealistic to expect Iran to remain “indifferent”.“Unfortunately, as things stand at the moment in the region, reaching a new state of equilibrium might simply be beyond reach for the foreseeable future.”Salehi urged the outside world to take heed of the results of last month’s Iranian presidential election and the message Iranians sent, but he said “engagement is simply not a one-way street and we cannot go it alone”.“Often following hard-won engagement, some western nations, whether distracted by short-sighted political motivations or the lucrative inducements of regional actors, walk away and allow the whole situation to return to the status quo ante,” wrote Salehi, who is also a vice-president of Iran.Salehi warned of “chaotic behaviour” and “further tension and conflict” if the other side disregarded Iran’s security concerns, failed to adhere to its commitments and insisted on what he called alternative facts including ideas such as the “clash of civilisations”, “Sunni-Shia conflict”, “Persian-Arab enmity” and the “Arab-Israeli axis against Iran”.Salehi, an MIT graduate scientist who has also served as foreign minister, was the second most senior Iranian negotiator, dealing with technical aspects, during nearly two years of talks between Tehran and six of the world’s major powers that led to the final nuclear accord in Vienna in July 2015.Although Trump has promised to “dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran”, he has not so far taken any concrete steps to scrap it.Trump’s first post-election foreign trip to Riyadh tilted the regional balance, and contributed in part to the diplomatic isolation of Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its allies, who have accused the tiny emirate of funding terrorists and appeasing Iran."

671,"Charles Rolls, the Co-founder of upmarket tonic water maker Fever-Tree, sold a stake of around 4% in the company for �73 million (around ?602 crore). Rolls cashed in the shares that have risen over 50% this year alone and are currently up 924% since its IPO in late 2014. After the sale, Rolls still owns around 11.2% of the company.","He once contracted malaria during a trip to Africa and has credited the chemical, obtained from the bark of the cinchona tree referenced in the company’s name, with saving his life.Though the company started out with tonic water, it has expanded to include variants on the drink, as well as Sicilian lemonade and ginger ale.It has managed to stand out from the crowd by consciously embracing luxury status, making much of the exotic origin of its ingredients and the great expense of getting them into your glass.Its ginger comes from Ivory Coast and Nigeria, its lemons from Sicily, and Warrillow once braved checkpoints manned by militiamen to source quinine from a remote part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.These are the credentials that have ensured no luxury hotel or Michelin-starred restaurant is without a supply of Fever-Tree in its mixer cabinet.Indeed, one of the company’s early customers was world-renowned chef Ferran Adrià, who made its tonic a firm fixture in his restaurant El Bulli, rated by many gastronomes as the world’s best and quirkiest restaurant before it served up its last liquid olive in 2011.Posh tonic has also benefited from a serendipitous resurgence in gin, increasingly seen as a sophisticated spirit worth splashing out on.Gin menus are a common feature of bars in countries where the spirit is particularly popular such as the UK, Spain and US.Charles Rolls, who launched premium tonic brand with Tim Warrillow, cashes in on soaring stock market valueFever-Tree, the upmarket tonic water maker, suffered the rarest of hiccups in its meteoric rise after co-founder Charles Rolls cashed in £73m of shares.The sale left the company’s stock down 2% at £17.12 on Thursday – but that is still nearly 13 times its £1.34 price tag when it floated less than three years ago.Demand for the shares from City investors was so great that Rolls offloaded 4.5m shares, a 3.9% stake, having initially planned to release 2.5m.He retains an 11.2% holding worth £222m, and the company is valued at nearly £2bn.That means Fever-Tree is worth more than Britvic, its 170-year old rival, more than the UK arm of Domino’s Pizza, and about three times as much as the Debenhams store chain.That is astonishing for a business with sales of just £100m and only 46 full-time staff that has done little more than concoct a fancy mixer for gin.“There’s no point having a good gin if the tonic isn’t right,” he said, pointing out that tonic makes up the lion’s share of a G&T, at least if it is made right.This year, Rolls ended his day-to-day involvement in the company, moving from executive deputy chairman to a non-executive position.That might explain why he feels able to start cashing in, a decision that might have given investors pause for thought if he were still engaged in building the business.And with an extra £73m in the bank, Rolls has little reason to wait until the sun is past the yard-arm for his first G&T of the day.And premium gins demand to be mixed with premium tonics.Fever-Tree has ridden the crest of this alcoholic wave like no other company, reporting pre-tax profits last year that more than doubled to £34.3m on sales of £102m.This month, the company announced that its 2017 results would comfortably exceed City forecasts, indicating that the Fever-Tree star is still very much in the ascendancy.Rolls, a former management consultant who revived the Plymouth Gin brand, and Warrilow, a former ad man, teamed up in an attempt to challenge the domination by Schweppes of the mixers market.Rolls had noticed that the world’s finest gins were mixed with the same mass-produced tonic.But it is testament to the super-speed growth the company has delivered since Rolls and co-founder Tim Warrillow launched it in 2005.From a standing start, the duo became millionaires within a decade, selling £25m of stock between them when they floated the company on the AIM market in 2014."

684,"More than 31 million people, that is one person every second, were displaced in their country in 2016 because of conflicts, violence and natural disasters, a Norwegian Refugee Council report has revealed. Adding that the Democratic Republic of the Congo was the worst affected country, the report said that natural disasters displaced over three times the number uprooted by conflicts. ","We just focus on the symptom, which is the people we see at our borders,” said Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council.He said there is a link with refugees – though the vast majority of displaced people do not have the opportunity or means to cross borders.Six of the 10 countries that produced the most refugees in 2015 – Afghanistan, Colombia, DRC, South Sudan and Syria – were also among the 10 with the largest number of internally displaced people.Egeland warned that without political intervention the situation will only get worse.“If you redirect attention to the countries of origin and to really understanding the driving forces of these movements it would be a much more strategic approach and investment,” added Bilak.Last year, an estimated 6.9 million people were forced to leave their homes as a result of conflict and violence.Norwegian Refugee Council report reveals extent of the hidden crisis that forced 31 million people – one every second – to flee within their countries last year Rebecca Ratcliffe  Mon 22 May 2017 00.00 EDT   Last modified on Wed 31 May 2017 05.53 EDT  Conflict, violence and natural disasters forced more than 31 million people to leave home and settle elsewhere within their countries last year, the equivalent of one person every second.But while the number of people uprooted by conflict outnumbers refugees by two to one, they have been largely ignored by the international community, according to a report by the Norwegian Refugee Council’s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre.“Unless the crisis and the factors that lead to this crisis are addressed they will re-erupt on a cyclical basis.”In May last year, the UN proposed (pdf) that governments commit to reducing the number of internally displaced people by at least 50% by 2030.The report warned this is little more than an aspiration, however.Last year, more aid was spent on refugee resettlement within donor nations than in the countries where displacement crises originated.“What we focus on is the symptom of this breakdown of protection and human rights of people in their local communities."
685,"""Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday ordered his cabinet to attend a welcome ceremony for US President Donald Trump, after discovering that many of them planned to skip the event, reports said. Notably, Israeli officials have criticised the visit as """"haphazard"""". Trump arrived in Israel on Monday in the second leg of his first overseas trip as President. ""","Israeli media reports say prime minister was angered to learn a number of ministers had planned to skip US president’s arrival Peter Beaumont in Jerusalem  Sun 21 May 2017 08.48 EDT   Last modified on Fri 9 Feb 2018 13.44 EST  Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has reportedly been forced to order his ministers to attend the airport reception for Donald Trump on Monday, after discovering that a number had planned not to attend.According to reports in the Israeli media, an angry Netanyahu was informed on Sunday that party heads and a number of ministers planned to skip the reception after the White House had asked for the meet and greet to be shortened to the two countries’ anthems and handshakes only between Netanyahu and Trump.Haaretz, the Times of Israel and the Jerusalem Post all carried stories, some quoting an identified Israeli government official on the instruction from Netanyahu, amid claims that ministers had been upset at not being included in the receiving line on the airport tarmac.The row is the latest in a series of controversies to hit the planned visit of the US president, which officials in Israel have privately characterised as often haphazard.Trump will arrive for the whirlwind visit to Israel and to the occupied Palestinian territories on Monday, amid mounting questions over what – if any – practical steps he will take to advance his “ultimate peace deal” between the two sides.Overshadowed by the escalating scandals surrounding him, the US president will meet Netanyahu and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, during 26 hours of events.Trump will arrive from Riyadh on Air Force One just before noon at Ben Gurion airport, accompanied by his wife, Melania, daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared, before flying by helicopter to Jerusalem.During his visit, Trump will briefly visit the Holocaust memorial at Yad Vashem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City, dine with Netanyahu and make a private visit to the Western Wall, Judaism’s most holy site.What noises that have emerged from reported leaks about Trump’s plans to advance peace suggest an implausible mishmash of ideas – including the idea that Israel be allowed to continue settlement building during talks.On the Israeli side the most significant outcome is a proposal for improving the economic quality of life for Palestinians on the West Bank, including longer opening hours for the Allenby Bridge crossing to Jordan, more building permits in the so-called area C and suggestions for new industrial zones on the West Bank.Lacking any clear prospects for a breakthrough, the runup to the visit has been dominated by mini – and sometimes concocted – controversies including the comment by a US official telling Netanyahu’s office that the Western Wall was not in Israeli territory.Trump will, however, become the first US president to visit the wall, a fact that was being spun last week by Jonathan Schanzer of the rightwing US Foundation for Defence of Democracies as a pro-Israel step.“I think that if Trump himself goes to the Western Wall and does it with Israeli officials, even Israeli security, there’s going to be very little argument over who controls it – certainly [when] going there to acknowledge it as a Jewish holy site,” said Schanzer.On the Palestinian side, officials appear content that the worst predictions regarding Trump on the Middle East – fuelled by his own campaign rhetoric – have not materialised.Since his inauguration on 20 January, those same rightwingers fear that Trump has drifted towards an ever more conventional US foreign policy position on the peace process.Far from moving the US embassy to Jerusalem on his first day in office – as he promised – Trump has kicked that issue into the long grass while expressing a sometimes garbled objection to Israeli settlement building.That has seen David Friedman, the controversial and pro-settler new US ambassador to Israel who arrived last week, move quickly to reassure Netanyahu’s government that Trump remains as firmly committed to Israel as ever, even as he suggested that no announcement on the US embassy would be made until after Trump’s visit.The messaging on the Israel-Palestine peace process has also been downbeat, with one US official telling Haaretz on Sunday that the height of Trump’s ambitions for his “ultimate deal” right now appears to involve no more than encouraging the two sides to play nicely to create conditions for direct talks.“The president has made a general statement regarding his view on settlements and he hopes the Israeli government takes it into account,” the official said.The visit comes at a tense time ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Six Day War in early June – which for Palestinians marks five decades of occupation – and amid a continuing hunger strike by hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails that has prompted sometimes violent demonstrations on the West Bank.Trump’s problems at home are also seen by some as having cast a pall over the proceedings, with Dan Shapiro, the former US ambassador to Israel under Barack Obama, predicting: “I think the trip’s in a lot of jeopardy [in] being able to be productive because of all the chaos and controversy that’s going on in Washington.” Despite the signs posted in Jerusalem neighbourhoods welcoming Trump as “a friend of Zion” and calling on hims to “make Israel great”, his visit is also causing anxieties for many on Israel’s right for whom Trump’s election was seen initially as the cause for unbridled celebration.We will also discuss ways to advance the peace.”The visit will take place under tight security with about 10,000 police securing the Israeli part of the visit, which will be accompanied by road closures."

This will let competitors produce their own KitKat copies without legal consequences.""","Protected “shape marks” are not without precedent — Toblerone, which is owned by Mondelēz, has successfully trademarked its “zigzag prism” shape.But the appeal judges found that while the four-finger shape might be “very well known” in association with KitKat, “that does not necessarily mean that the public have come to perceive the shape as a badge of origin such that they would rely upon it alone to identify the product as coming from a particular source.“They might simply regard the shape as a characteristic of products of that kind or they might find it brings to mind the product and brand name with which they have become familiar.“These kinds of recognition and association do not amount to distinctiveness for trademark purposes.”The judges also noted that the chocolate bar’s shape had not been central to its marketing in recent years: “It has nothing, therefore, to do with the informed choices that consumers make between similar products.”The judges heard that Nestlé had spent between £3m and £11m a year advertising and promoting KitKats between 1996 and 2007.The court of appeal ruled that the four-finger design had “no inherent distinctiveness”.After deliberating for months, the three appeals judges delivered their judgment on Wednesday in a 16,000-word ruling that found the KitKat shape was not a “badge of origin”.“We are concerned here with ... the three-dimensional shape of a chocolate product, that has no inherent distinctiveness,” said Lord Justice Kitchin.The ruling marks the latest stage in a bitter-tasting battle between Nestlé and Mondelēz, the US owner of Cadbury, that have been battling over the KitKat trademark for seven years.Nestle’s appeal followed a UK high court ruling in January last year that blocked the trademark attempt.Nestlé’s four-finger shape has been granted trademark registration in many countries of the world, for instance Germany, France, Australia, South Africa and Canada, further protecting it from imitations.”Following the appeal ruling, a Mondelēz spokesperson said: “As we have previously stated, we do not believe the shape of the KitKat bar should be protected as a trademark in the UK.”The case turned on whether a the product’s shapewas sufficiently distinctive to the brand to prevent any other manufacturer using a similar format.The confectionery multinational Nestlé has lost the latest round of its long-running battle with rivals Cadbury to trademark the shape of the KitKat bar in the UK.The company could potentially try to take the case to the UK supreme court.“Nestlé is disappointed by the court of appeal judgment and is considering its next steps,” said the spokesperson."

Researchers estimate that around 100 million landmines left from previous conflicts, scattered in 70 countries injure up to 20,000 people a year. The mines release vapours, smelling which the sprayed bacteria glow and get detected by lasers.","Encased in polymer beads scattered on the suspected minefield, that fluorescence is then detected by a laser system that researchers suggest could be mounted on a vehicle – including drones.The system has been successfully tested in a field of real landmines, scanning the ground at a rate of around 18cm per second – a speed the researchers hope to increase.Belkin’s team is not the first to develop bacteria that glow in the presence of explosive vapour – similar findings were reported by a team at Edinburgh University in 2009 – but it appears to be the first to have developed a potentially functioning detection system using the technology.“Our field data show that engineered biosensors may be useful in a landmine detection system,” said Prof Shimshon Belkin, who headed the experiment.Mine clearance work is typically dangerous, labour-intensive and costly.The team at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University has tested mine detection using bacteria genetically modified to give off a fluorescent signal when mines – often made out plastic – are close, which can then be detected with a laser.Reporting the findings in the journal Nature Biotechnology, the researchers say their approach relies on tiny amounts of vapour given off by the explosives in the mines.It was recognised that some plants reacted to those vapours, and the research used modified bacteria that essentially glow in contact with the explosive vapour.However, the technology would need to be developed further still, he added.“For this to be possible, several challenges need to be overcome, such as enhancing the sensitivity and stability of the sensor bacteria, improving scanning speeds to cover large areas, and making the scanning apparatus more compact so it can be used on board a light unmanned aircraft or drone.”The university said in a statement: “This appears to be the first demonstration of a functional standoff landmine detection system.” A byproduct of the research by Belkin and his team was announced three years ago: the use of modified bacteria to detect pollutants in water, suggesting further applications for the technology.Team at Israel’s Hebrew University test system that uses lasers and modified bacteria to locate buried devices  Peter Beaumont in Jerusalem  Thu 13 Apr 2017 05.22 EDT   Last modified on Mon 27 Nov 2017 21.05 EST  A team of researchers at an Israeli university has successfully tested a technology using fluorescent bacteria and lasers that could become a safer system for detecting buried landmines.An estimated 100m landmines are scattered in some 70 countries, a legacy of often long-past conflict, and the devices injure up to 20,000 people a year."

883,"Scientists have developed a test that can predict the age at which a person could develop Alzheimer's. The test calculates the risk of onset of disease based on genetic markers developed from data of over 70,000 individuals having Alzheimer's and otherwise. Researchers said that while genetics can influence the risk of dementia, a healthy lifestyle can also curb the risk.","Those ranked in the top 10% in terms of risk were more than three times as likely to develop Alzheimer’s during the course of the study, and did so more than a decade before those who ranked in the lowest 10%.Rahul Desikan, of the University of California – who led the international effort, said the test could be used to calculate any individual’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s that year.“That is, if you don’t already have dementia, what is your yearly risk for AD onset, based on your age and genetic information,” he said.The so-called polygenic hazard score test was developed using genetic data from more than 70,000 individuals, including patients with Alzheimer’s disease and healthy elderly people.It is already known that genetics plays a powerful role in Alzheimer’s.The test was then used to accurately predict an individual’s risk of getting the disease in an independent patient cohort.In people with the high-risk version of ApoE, those ranked in the top 10% of risk on the new test got Alzheimer’s at an average age of 84 years, compared with 95 years for those ranked in the lowest 10%.James Pickett, head of research at Alzheimer’s Society, said: “Preventing the development of dementia symptoms is the holy grail of Alzheimer’s research but to succeed we first need accurate methods to predict who is most likely to develop the condition.One version of ApoE appears to reduce risk by up to 40%, while those with two copies (one from each parent) of the high-risk version can increase risk by 12 times.The latest study takes a new approach, showing that, aside from ApoE, there are thousands of background genetic variations that each have a tiny influence on Alzheimer’s risk, but whose cumulative influence is substantial.The researchers first identified nearly 2,000 single letter differences in the genetic code (known as SNPs) and, after ranking them for influence, developed a test based on 31 of the markers.Test based on 31 genetic markers could be used to calculate any individual’s yearly risk for onset of diseaseScientists have developed a new genetic test for Alzheimer’s risk that can be used to predict the age at which a person will develop the disease.A high score on the test, which is based on 31 genetic markers, can translate to being diagnosed many years earlier than those with a low-risk genetic profile, the study found.This study’s approach was fairly successful at predicting the likelihood of someone developing dementia over the coming year, but needs to be tested further in mixed, non-US populations.” Pickett added that, while the score could help to identify people for trials, it was too early to apply it as a genetic testing tool for use in the clinic.Rosa Sancho, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said that while genetic makeup can influence the chances of developing dementia, a healthy diet, regular physical activity and remaining mentally active can also drive down the risk."

899,"Employers may bar staff from wearing visible religious symbols, including women wearing Islamic headscarves at work, European Court of Justice ruled on Tuesday. However, customers cannot demand that workers remove headscarves if the company has no policy barring religious symbols, it stated. Notably, this is the EU court's first decision on the issue of women wearing Islamic headscarves at work.","“Of course companies have to be allowed to ban the wearing of headscarves.”The ECJ issued a joint judgment in the cases of two women, from France and Belgium, who were dismissed for refusing to remove headscarves.“An internal rule of an undertaking which prohibits the visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination,” the court said.It ruled that a company’s wish to project a neutral image was legitimate and allowed internal rules banning political, philosophical or religious symbols.The first case was referred to the ECJ by the Belgian courts.She had been told before taking the job that wearing a headscarf might pose problems for the company’s customers.In Achbita’s case the ECJ followed the advice of a senior legal adviser to the court, who argued that companies should be allowed to have policies banning the wearing of religious and political symbols.“The court of justice finds that G4S’s internal rule refers to the wearing of visible signs of political, philosophical or religious beliefs and therefore covers any manifestation of such beliefs without distinction.“However, in the absence of such a rule, the willingness of an employer to take account of the wishes of a customer no longer to have the employer’s services provided by a worker wearing an Islamic headscarf cannot be considered an occupational requirement that could rule out discrimination.”The ECJ did not rule on whether Bougnaoui’s dismissal was based on her failure to observe company policies, saying this was a matter for the French court to determine.The German broadsheet Süddeutsche Zeitung predicted that the ruling would fundamentally change how German courts assess similar cases, because the assumption since 2002 had been that religious symbols could not be banned from the workplace on anything other than safety grounds.He said the ECJ had not referred to this case law or attempted to deal with the distinction between freedom of religion and non-discrimination.The ECHR is the high court of the 47-member Council of Europe and not part of the EU.European court of justice says garments can be banned as part of general policy covering religious and political symbols Share your views on the ruling Jennifer Rankin in Brussels and  Philip Oltermann in Berlin  Tue 14 Mar 2017 13.02 EDT   First published on Tue 14 Mar 2017 05.18 EDT  Politicians on the right have welcomed a ruling by the EU’s highest court that allows companies to ban staff from wearing visible religious symbols, as a long-awaited legal judgment ricocheted into the French and Dutch election campaigns.In its first decision on the issue of women wearing Islamic headscarves at work, the European court of justice in Luxembourg ruled the garments could be banned, but only as part of a general policy barring all religious and political symbols.Nor can customers simply demand workers remove headscarves if the company has no policy barring religious symbols, the court ruled on Tuesday.The long-awaited ruling came on the eve of Dutch elections, where Muslim immigration has been a contentious issue."
