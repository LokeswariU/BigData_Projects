A Norwegian anti-immigrant group has been roundly ridiculed after members apparently mistook a photograph of six empty bus seats posted on its Facebook page for a group of women wearing burqas.“Tragic”, “terrifying” and “disgusting” were among the comments posted by members of the closed Fedrelandet viktigst, or “Fatherland first”, group beneath the photograph, according to screenshots on the Norwegian news website Nettavisen.Other members of the 13,000-strong group, for people “who love Norway and appreciate what our ancestors fought for”, wondered whether the non-existent passengers might be carrying bombs or weapons beneath their clothes. “This looks really scary,” wrote one. “Should be banned. You can’t tell who’s underneath. Could be terrorists.”Further comments read: “Ghastly. This should never happen,” “Islam is and always will be a curse,” “Get them out of our country – frightening times we are living in,” and: “I thought it would be like this in the year 2050, but it is happening NOW,” according to thelocal.no and other media.The photograph, found on the internet, was posted “for a joke” last week by Johan Slåttavik, who has since described himself as “Norway’s worst web troll and proud of it”, beneath a question asking the group: “What do people think of this?”Slåttavik told Nettavisen and Norway’s TV2 he wanted to “highlight the difference between legitimate criticism of immigration and blind racism”, and was “interested to see how people’s perceptions of an image are influenced by how others around them react. I ended up having a good laugh.”It went viral in Norway after Sindre Beyer, a former Labour party MP who said he has been following Fatherland first for some time, published 23 pages of screenshots of the group’s outraged comments.“What happens when a photo of some empty bus seats is posted to a disgusting Facebook group, and nearly everyone thinks they see a bunch of burqas?” he asked in a post shared more than 1,800 times. The comments suggested the vast majority of the anti-immigrant group’s members saw the photo as evidence of the ongoing “Islamification” of Norway, although a small number pointed out it was in fact a picture of bus seats. One warned the group was making itself look ridiculous.Beyer told Nettavisen: “I’m shocked at how much hate and fake news is spread [on the Fedrelandet viktigst page]. So much hatred against empty bus seats certainly shows that prejudice wins out over wisdom.”The head of Norway’s Antiracist Centre, Rune Berglund Steen, told the site that people plainly “see what they want to see – and what these people want to see are dangerous Muslims”.Norway recently became the latest European country to propose restrictions on the wearing of burqas and niqabs, tabling a law that will bar them from kindergartens, schools and universities. France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Bulgaria and the German state of Bavaria all restrict full-face veils in some public places.The country’s minority government, a coalition of the centre-right Conservatives and the populist Progress party that faces elections next month, said in June it was confident it would find opposition support for the move.Per Sandberg, then acting immigration and integration minister, told a press conference that face-covering garments such as the niqab or burqa “do not belong in Norwegian schools. The ability to communicate is a basic value.”"
1,"Investigators have released pictures showing how close an Air Canada flight came to crashing onto four planes at a US airport last month. Its pilots mistakenly descended towards a taxiway, where four planes were parked, instead of the runway before aborting the landing.

Newly released data and photos show how shockingly low an Air Canada jet was when it pulled up to avoid crashing into planes waiting on a San Francisco international airport taxiway last month. The Air Canada pilots mistook the taxiway for the runway next to it and flew their jet to just 59ft (18m) above ground before pulling up to attempt another landing, according to National Transportation Safety Board information released on Wednesday.That’s barely taller than the four planes that were on the taxiway when the incident occurred late at night on 7 July. Pilots in a United plane alerted air traffic controllers about the off-course jet, while the crew of a Philippine Airlines jet behind it switched on their plane’s landing lights in an apparent last-ditch danger signal to Air Canada. NTSB investigators said they have not determined probable cause for the incident that came within a few feet of becoming one of the worst disasters in aviation history.“It was close, much too close,” said John Cox, a safety consultant and retired airline pilot.The investigators said that as the Air Canada jet approached the taxiway just before midnight after a flight from Toronto, it was so far off course that it did not appear on a radar system used to prevent runway collisions.Those systems were not designed to spot planes that are lined up to land on a taxiway a rare occurrence, especially for airline pilots. But the Federal Aviation Administration is working on modifications so they can, agency spokesman Ian Gregor said.Both pilots of the Air Canada Airbus A320 jet were very experienced. The captain, who was flying the plane, had more than 20,000 hours of flying time, and the co-pilot had about 10,000 hours.The pilots told investigators “that they did not recall seeing aircraft on taxiway but that something did not look right to them,” the NTSB said.Investigators could not hear what the Air Canada captain and co-pilot said to each other during the aborted landing because their conversation was recorded over when the plane made other flights, starting with a San Francisco-to-Montreal trip the next morning. Recorders are required to capture only the last two hours of a plane’s flying time.Peter Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for Air Canada, declined to comment, citing the investigation. "

Two people were killed when a light plane made an emergency landing on a beach near Lisbon, Portuguese authorities have said.The two sunbathers, a 56-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl, died while others ran into the sea when the plane came down on Wednesday.Hundreds of sunbathers were on the popular São João da Caparica beach, 12 miles (20km) to the south of Lisbon, at the time. Officials said they were not aware of any other injuries.“A plane with two people on board made an emergency landing on São João da Caparica beach, striking two sunbathers and causing their deaths,” Portugal’s national maritime authority said in a statement. “It happened very fast, there was no chance to prepare ... to run,” Enrique Coelho, who was playing with his son at the beach and saw the plane crash, told local media.The victims were hit by the plane, the commander of the port of Lisbon, Jose Isabel, confirmed.The two occupants of the plane were unhurt and were being questioned by officers from Portugal’s national maritime police. The small aircraft, a Cessna, appeared to be in difficulty and wobbled as it skimmed low over the sunbathers, scattering them and spreading panic on the beach, witnesses said.The plane appeared to have a partly broken left wing, which hung lower than the right wing, according to Portuguese TV pictures. Local reports said the aircraft was registered to a flying school in Torres Vedras.The Portuguese newspaper Diário de Notícias reported that the Aerocondor aviation school in Cascais had confirmed the aircraft – a Cessna CS–AVA – was “on a training flight with one student and one senior instructor”, who had “high experience and thousands of hours of flying time”.The dead girl was with her parents, who were unhurt, witnesses told local media. The plane passed over the dead man’s legs as he sunbathed on a towel, they said.One witness, Rita Rogado, 20, told the Público newspaper that the plane crashed right by the sea, dragging her along for a few metres in the sand. Some sunbathers said the plane appeared to be gliding, as they heard no engine noise.• This article was amended on 3 August 2017.

A suspected British prankster appears to have conned White House officials including Anthony Scaramucci into replying to him after pretending in email correspondence to be several different members of the Trump team.The man, who goes by the Twitter handle @SINON_REBORN, posed as Jared Kushner well enough to convince homeland security adviser Tom Bossert to reply to him, according to CNN. Bossert included his personal email address in the exchange.Named director of communications after having been denied a White House role earlier, the New York financier and Republican fundraiser promptly threatened to fire everyone in his team over leaks. He also staged a combative and contradictory briefing room debut and talkshow tour; sought to bat away questions about suspiciously liberal pronouncements in his past and support for Trump’s Republican enemies; deleted tweets; warred openly with the former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and seemingly forced him out; compared the struggle to take healthcare away from millions of Americans to Lincoln’s battle against slavery; poured obscene invective about leakers, Priebus and Steve Bannon down the phone to a New Yorker reporter; missed the birth of his son; saw his wife file for divorce; and was asked to resign.Trump’s first national security adviser – one of four generals the president has employed – resigned after it was revealed he misled Vice-President Mike Pence over his contacts with Russians during the election campaign. It was later reported that Yates had warned the White House Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail.The most shocking firing of them all. Trump sacked his FBI director, by messenger rather than in person, as congressional and justice department investigations into links between Trump aides and Russia gathered pace. Lest anyone retain any doubt about why Trump pressed the big red button, he told NBC in a primetime interview the firing was tied to “this Russia thing”. The reverberations will be felt for some time yet.The long-suffering but loyal surrogate for the president handed in his resignationin response to Scaramucci’s appointment. A Republican insider and Priebus ally, he never settled into the press secretary role after an infamous debut in which he angrily insisted Trump’s fantastic version of crowd sizes at the inauguration were true. Achieving by way of Melissa McCarthy’s lethal Saturday Night Live impression a somewhat dubious celebrity, his days at the White House were long rumoured to be numbered. His departure on a point of principle having seemingly been justified only 10 days later, he may now claim a sort of hollow vindication.The former Republican National Committee chair stayed loyal – at least in public – to Trump through Friday, when he was told his time was up. He stayed loyal after handing in his resignation too, rhapsodising about the president and his mission in interviews with CNN and, of course, Fox News. But it seemed Priebus’s card had alway been marked, less over his initial blocking of Scaramucci, which enraged the Mooch, or by his closeness to the House speaker, Paul Ryan, than by his private advice to Trump to quit the presidential race after 8 October, when the infamous Access Hollywood “Gropegate” tape was published. The Washington Post reported that Priebus was thus never considered a member of the “Oct 8th coalition”, a name for the inner cabal of Trumpites who have never wavered, however low their boss’s reputation has sunk.The man also fooled Scaramucci, the White House communications director who was fired on Monday, by pretending to be Reince Priebus, the former Trump administration chief of staff with whom he was believed to be in open warfare.In a series of emails, the man posing as Priebus baited Scaramucci, accusing him of being “breathtakingly hypocritical” and saying “at no stage have you acted in a way that is remotely classy”.Scaramucci responded: “You know what you did. We all do. Even today. But rest assured we were prepared. A Man would apologize.”The heated exchange continued, with the prankster writing: “I can’t believe you are questioning my ethics! The so called ‘Mooch’, who can’t even manage his first week in the White House without leaving upset in his wake. I have nothing to apologize for.”Scaramucci replied: “Read Shakespeare. Particularly Othello. You are right there. My family is fine by the way and will thrive. I know what you did. No more replies from me.” The White House has confirmed it is looking into the matter. “We take all cyber related issues very seriously and are looking into these incidents further,” press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told CNN.Reince (me) giving @Scaramucci something to think about. He never replied haha pic.twitter.com/hutjACmogRAn excerpt of what I emailed to @Scaramucci whilst playing the part of Jon Huntsman Jr. Apparently this didn't seem out of the ordinary?! 😂🤡 pic.twitter.com/6INHJi3KCDThe man, who described himself as a “lazy anarchist” on his Twitter profile, told CNN that his actions were meant to be “humorous” not malicious.“I’m not trying to get the keys to the vault or anything like that.”He has previously convinced Scaramucci that he was the ambassador to Russia-designate Jon Hunstman and tricked Hunstman himself into believing he was the president’s son Eric Trump. He also fleetingly convinced Eric Trump he was his brother, Donald Jr. "

A GP who practised in east London has been charged with 118 sexual offences. Manish Shah, of Brunel Close in Romford, is accused of 65 counts of assault by penetration and 52 allegations of sexual assault, the Metropolitan police said. The 47-year-old is also charged with one count of sexual assault on a child under 13. The offences were alleged to have occurred at a GP practice between June 2004 and July 2013 and relate to 54 victims.The charges announced on Wednesday follow a long-running investigation into Shah. He has been bailed several times, having first been arrested in 2013.He is due to appear at Barkingside magistrates court on Thursday 31 August. Shah is registered as a doctor working with the national health service. The police investigation began over four years ago, after claims of sexual assault were made to detectives, and uncovered a series of allegations concerning alleged sexual offences.Specialist detectives from Scotland Yard’s sexual abuse command have been involved in investigating the claims. The decision to bring a series of criminal charges against Shah was authorised by the Crown Prosecution Service.The NHS has set up a dedicated number for any individuals who may have concerns or questions on 0800 011 4253."

The AA has fired its boss, Bob Mackenzie, for “gross misconduct”, with immediate effect, wiping nearly a fifth off the value of the company and making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 250.“Bob Mackenzie has been removed by the board from his role as executive chairman, from his other roles and as a director and as an employee of the company, for gross misconduct,” the AA said.A spokesperson for the roadside repair company said the sacking was a “personal conduct related matter”, but gave no further details. It is not believed to involve fraud.However, a statement attributed by the Times to Mackenzie’s son, Peter Mackenzie, said his father had a serious health issue and had resigned. The statement said his father had tendered his resignation and resigned his directorships due to acute ill health. “He is very unwell and has been admitted to hospital,” it said. “The family trusts that all parties will act responsibly towards a loyal servant of the company in a manner which reflects the stress he has been suffering.”The company declined to comment beyond its initial statement.The shock announcement sent shares down as much as 18% at one point. The shares closed down 14%, wiping about £200m off the value of the company.Mackenzie, 65, has been executive chairman of the AA since 2014, when he was instrumental in a stock market flotation of the company. His previous roles include chairman and chief executive of National Car Parks and its subsidiary Green Flag, a rival car breakdown business.The AA said Mackenzie’s responsibilities would be split, with Simon Breakwell, a non-executive director since 2014 and a founder of the travel company Expedia, appointed as acting chief executive. John Leach, who was senior independent director, has been appointed as chairman.The company had already announced plans to split the combined roles of executive chairman, with the aim of appointing a chief executive.In a trading update published alongside the announcement of Mackenzie’s departure, the AA said it was confident about the company’s long-term prospects but its financial performance in the first half of 2017 had been hit by a number of factors.“The financial performance in the first six months has been negatively impacted by the effect of erratic work load patterns on an inherently fixed cost base. This was especially true in June and July which saw significant spikes in demand.“We now expect the full-year performance to be broadly in line with that of the last financial year.”The AA said paid members totalled 3.33 million in the first six months of the year, an increase of 6,000 compared with the same period a year earlier. The company would publish first-half results on 26 September. “At that stage, Simon Breakwell will be in a position to provide an update on our plans,” the company said.Analysts at Liberum noted their surprise at Mackenzie’s departure, adding that they “do not believe that it is fraud-related”.They revised down their expectations for full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by 3% to £403m, but said the company had made progress in some areas. “After the accelerated [stock market listing] in July 2014, management had acquired a strategic asset akin to a desirable residence in Mayfair, where the plumbing and electrics were in need of investment,” the Liberum analysts said. “We now believe that the face-lift is largely complete.“Some of the key metrics are generally encouraging, although that may be lost today. The transformation may have taken longer but there is tangible evidence of improvement.”The AA said that existing board member Andrew Blowers would replace John Leach as senior independent director, while Martin Clarke continues as finance director."
7,"UK tobacco company British American Tobacco (BAT) is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over allegations about involvement in bribery and corruption in Africa. BAT has denied allegations of a whistleblower who handed over multiple documents to SFO. However, BAT has said it is cooperating with UK authorities as campaigners are now urging US government to act.","British American Tobacco says it is cooperating with UK authorities as campaigners urge US government to actAllegations that British American Tobacco was involved in bribery and corruption in Africa are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office, despite the cigarette company’s attempts to downplay the significance of a whistleblower who handed over a dossier of evidence.BAT, now the largest tobacco company in the world after the recent merger with Reynolds, has consistently denied the allegations of Paul Hopkins, whom it employed in Africa for 13 years. When Hopkins handed over a large number of documents to the SFO in December 2015, BAT dismissed him as “a rogue former employee”.The company later toned down its criticism, stating that it had appointed a team of external legal advisers to investigate the charges.The SFO’s inquiries have now become a formal investigation. In a statement it said it was “investigating suspicions of corruption in the conduct of business by BAT, its subsidiaries and associated persons”. It invited members of the public to come forward with any evidence they might have.The news follows a major Guardian investigation revealing that BAT and other multinationals have used threats against at least eight African nations, demanding they axe or dilute the kind of tobacco control measures that have saved millions of lives in the west.BAT said it continued to conduct its own inquiries into Hopkins’ charges. “We have been cooperating with the Serious Fraud Office and British American Tobacco has been informed that the SFO has now opened a formal investigation. BAT intends to cooperate with that investigation,” it said.The company would not confirm whether the investigation concerned the allegations made by Hopkins.He has claimed he paid bribes on the company’s behalf to the Kenya Revenue Authority for access to information that BAT could use against its Kenyan competitor Mastermind. Hopkins also claimed that BAT Kenya had paid bribes to government officials in Burundi, Rwanda and Comoros to undermine tobacco control regulations.BAT hired the law firm Linklaters in February 2016 to conduct a “full investigation” into the claims made by Hopkins. BAT later dropped Linklaters and appointed Slaughter and May as sole adviser on the case.Louis Charalambous, Hopkins’ solicitor, said BAT had changed its tone. “We note, with interest, that BAT have abandoned their earlier PR strategy of trying to shoot the messenger,” he said in a statement.“Paul Hopkins blew the whistle during his time at BAT and their internal team ignored him. Previously BAT tried to wriggle out by saying that Mr Hopkins had left their employ in acrimonious circumstances when, in fact, that was untrue. They also wrongly suggested that he had acted on his own, and portrayed themselves as the victims.“Now their new external law firm and revised PR strategy are silent about Mr Hopkins. They need to go further and set the record straight. The company cannot rewrite this history, and we look forward to seeing them answer these allegations in due course.”Hopkins said he had turned whistleblower at a cost to himself. “I rejected an enhanced redundancy package designed to force me to sign a global confidentially agreement and just took statutory redundancy instead,” he said.Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of the campaigning charity Ash, said: “At the time the allegations of fraud in Africa were first made against BAT the company accused the whistle blower of having a vendetta against the company and peddling falsehoods.“Eighteen months later and BAT is having to admit it’s under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. The SFO must leave no stone unturned.”Matthew Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called on the US government to also investigate BAT. “The allegations against British American Tobacco are serious and should be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” he said.“As British American Tobacco now operates the largest publicly traded tobacco company within the United States, we urge the US Department of Justice to also investigate the company’s alleged misconduct.”The BAT chief executive, Nicandro Durante, told the Financial Times in March that the firm would “act in a very strong way” if wrongdoing was found to have taken place. He said: “We are in 200 countries, so I cannot give a 100% guarantee that everything’s going to go by the book.”The SFO investigation is another blow to the company, after the US health watchdog, the Food and Drug Administration, announced tighter regulations on the tobacco industry, which hit shares in tobacco firms."

Tom Hiddleston is to star in a Kenneth Branagh-directed production of Hamlet – but for only three weeks in a theatre with 160 seats.The production will raise money for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) and promises to be one of the hottest theatrical tickets of recent years. The ballot opens at noon on Tuesday 1 August and tickets will be difficult for people to get their hands on.Hiddleston, a Rada graduate, said Hamlet presented “almost limitless possibilities for interpretation”.He added: “Kenneth Branagh and I have long talked about working on the play together, and now felt like the right time, at the right place.“The performing arts exist to bring people together, not to break or keep them apart. I hope the funds raised by the production will help Rada continue to provide a wider field of equal opportunity to train actors, stage managers and technical theatre artists, from every background, to a standard of excellence and professionalism. We need to keep the doors open for everyone.”The production is a collaboration between Rada and Branagh’s theatre company, which recently had a year’s residency at the Garrick in the West End.It will run in Rada’s 160-seat Jerwood Vanbrugh theatre in central London from 1-23 September. The ballot for tickets is open online until 6pm on 6 August – or by phone until 5pm on 5 August.Ticket winners will be selected at random with successful entrants able to purchase a maximum of two. Twenty per cent of the tickets will be priced £15 and available only to under-25s. A further 20% will be £45 and the remainder £95.In something of a first, there will be no guaranteed tickets for critics, with journalists welcome to take their chances in the ballot.To prevent the risk of a black market, people will only be able to collect their tickets up to an hour before the show with documentation to prove who they are.The money raised from the production will support the Rada Attenborough project, which aims to raise £20m for the regeneration of the academy’s premises on Chenies Street including, for the first time, the provision of on-site accommodation.Branagh said the production would be a celebration of both Shakespeare and Rada. “The play speaks as loudly as ever to our volatile world and we are proud to have Tom Hiddleston lead an exciting group of actors, as he plays the title role for the first time. This work has been in discussion and planning over a period of years. To find its expression at, with, and for Rada, is a privilege,” he said."
9,"""Speaking ahead of his final appearance on the field at the upcoming world championships, eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt warned his fellow athletes that they must stop doping otherwise track and field will die. On being asked about how he would feel in the 100m final at the upcoming world championships, Bolt said, """"Unbeatable and unstoppable"""".""","Usain Bolt has issued a stark warning to his fellow athletes that they must stop doping otherwise track and field will die. The triple Olympic 100m and 200m champion insisted that the sport was on the mend following the staggering revelations of state-sponsored doping in Russia but conceded more needed to be done to tackle the scourge of performance-enhancing drugs.“I don’t think it gets any worse than that,” he said, referring to the problems in Russia which he agreed had left the sport at rock bottom. “But it’s on its way back up now. Hopefully, athletes will see what’s going on and understand that if they don’t stop what they’re doing the sport will die. And hopefully they will understand what the sport is going through and what they need to do as athletes to help it move forward.”But Bolt, who will hang up his spikes after the world championships in London which start on Friday, said he was still optimistic that these perennial problems could be tackled. “You can’t be happy about doping at all, it’s not good for the sport,” he added. “But over the years we’re doing a better job, it’s getting clean and we’re catching up to a lot of athletes. There’s an understanding that, listen, if you cheat you will get caught. Over time the sport will get better.“I said a couple of years ago it had to get really bad, when there’s nowhere else to go but up. The only way track and field has left to go is up.”Bolt has raced only three times this season, and last month appeared to be struggling with a back injury, but he insisted he was still the man to beat in the 100m, the qualifying rounds for which start on Friday. “For some reason I am the underdog,” he said. “That is what my team keep telling me so I have to prove myself once more. But I am confident in my abilities, always. When I go out there I am fully confident and ready to go – 100%.“The last 100m race I ran was a 9.95sec which shows I am going in the right direction. It is all about who can keep their nerves. I have been here many times and I know I am ready. It is go time.”Bolt, who turns 31 later this month, also gave an emphatic answer when asked how he would feel on Saturday night after the 100m final. “Unbeatable,” he said. “Usain Bolt has retired unbeatable over that event. For me that will be the biggest headline. Unbeatable and unstoppable.”The Jamaican also insisted that he had been provided with extra motivation to win yet another world title following the tragic death of his close friend Germaine Mason, the Olympic silver medal winning high jumper, in a road accident in April.“It was a rough time,” he said. “I have never had someone who passed away so close to me.

Scores of easyJet passengers were stranded on the Greek island of Zakynthos (also known as Zante) after their plane developed technical difficulties and a replacement aircraft was prevented from flying in because of mating turtles. Passengers expressed fury at easyJet’s lack of communication and “incredibly bad” handling of the delay, which began on Sunday afternoon.  Some travellers, who did not book on to other flights, were only able to make it home on Tuesday.  A fault with a wing flap was announced by the captain soon after passengers boarded the flight to Gatwick at around 3pm on Sunday, and there was no communication for another hour.  Despite being told the problem would be resolved in 20 minutes, passengers were soon asked to disembark.  They were forced to wait through “hours of nothingness,” according to Rebecca Morris, 39, who was travelling with her husband and two small children.  She described the facilities at Zakynthos airport as “basic” and said there was no help or guidance from easyJet apart from the odd automated text message.  “There was no food or refreshments and there was no representative from easyJet,” Morris said.  She said that while her family’s travel agents helped them find accommodation and taxis, other passengers were left to “fend for themselves”.  A similar process was repeated on Monday.  The airline said the night curfew – apparently in place because of vulnerable loggerhead turtles breeding nearby – had prevented an alternative aircraft being sent out. The sea turtle breeding season is well under way in Zakynthos. According to Archelon, a group dedicated in protecting sea turtles in Greece, late June to early July see the highest levels of spawning. The group has recorded 500 nests on the island so far, but that is fewer than in previous years. EasyJet later apologised for the delay. A spokesman said: “Unfortunately easyJet was unable to operate flight EZY8746 from Zante to London Gatwick on Sunday 30 July due to a technical fault with the aircraft and had to delay the flight overnight.  “Engineers were immediately dispatched to Zante and believed that the technical issue was rectified yesterday, however it then reoccurred before boarding which meant the flight could not operate. The safety of our passengers and crew is our highest priority and we will only operate if it is safe to do so.  “We do all possible to try and minimise delays and as such planned to send a replacement aircraft. Unfortunately, due to the night curfew rule at the airport, we were unable to get the replacement aircraft into the airport. The flight departed Zante and arrived at London Gatwick today.  “Around a quarter of passengers travelled on flights with alternative carriers yesterday afternoon. Passengers have been provided with hotel accommodation and expenses in line with EU261 regulations and will also be entitled to EU261 compensation.”"

There is only a 5% chance that the Earth will avoid warming by at least 2C come the end of the century, according to new research that paints a sobering picture of the international effort to stem dangerous climate change.Global trends in the economy, emissions and population growth make it extremely unlikely that the planet will remain below the 2C threshold set out in the Paris climate agreement in 2015, the study states. The Paris accord, signed by 195 countries, commits to holding the average global temperature to “well below 2C” above pre-industrial levels and sets a more aspirational goal to limit warming to 1.5C. This latter target is barely plausible, the new research finds, with just a 1% chance that temperatures will rise by less than 1.5C. “We’re closer to the margin than we think,” said Adrian Raftery, a University of Washington academic who led the research, published in Nature Climate Change. “If we want to avoid 2C, we have very little time left. The public should be very concerned.” Governments settled on the 2C threshold partly through political expediency but also because scientists have warned of severe consequences from sea level rise, drought, heatwaves and social unrest should the temperature rise beyond this.  Such risks have been underscored by a separate study, also released on Monday, that shows unabated climate change will cause around 60,000 deaths globally in 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100. The study, by the University of North Carolina, found that rising temperatures will exacerbate air pollutants that will particularly threaten those with existing conditions.  According to the University of Washington study, there is a 90% likelihood that temperatures will rise between 2C and 4.9C by 2100. This would put the world in the mid-range warming scenarios mapped out by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It negates the most optimistic outcome as well as the worst case, which would see temperatures climb nearly 6C beyond the pre-industrial era. Rather than look at how greenhouse gases will influence temperature, the new research analyzed the past 50 years of trends in world population, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted for each dollar of economic activity. After building a statistical model covering a range of emissions scenarios, the researchers found that carbon intensity will be a crucial factor in future warming. Technological advances are expected to cut global carbon intensity by 90% over the course of the century, with sharp declines in China and India – two newly voracious consumers of energy. However, this decline still will not be steep enough to avoid breaching the 2C limit.  The world’s population is expected to grow to about 11 billion people by 2100, but the research found that this will have a relatively small impact upon temperatures as much of this growth will take place in sub-Saharan Africa, which is a minor contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. It has long been acknowledged that emissions cuts promised under the the Paris agreement would not be sufficient to avoid 2C warming. However, it is hoped that periodic reviews of commitments will result in more severe reductions. Donald Trump’s pledge to remove the US, the world’s second-largest emitter, from the accord has cast a large shadow over these ambitions.  “Even if the 2C target isn’t met, action is very important,” said Raftery. “The more the temperature increases, the worse the impacts will be. “We would warn against any tendency to use our results to say that we won’t avoid 2C, and so it’s too late to do anything. On the contrary, avoiding the higher temperature increases that our model envisages is even more important, and also requires urgent action.” Raftery acknowledged that a breakthrough technology could “dramatically” change the outlook but noted that major advances of the past 50 years, such as the computer, robotics, hybrid cars, the internet and electronic fuel injection, have improved carbon efficiency steadily at around 2% a year, rather than in huge jumps. Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University who was not involved in the study, said the research’s conclusions were “reasonable” but said it was difficult to assign a precise probability to future temperature rises. “I agree that staying below 2C and 1.5C are unlikely and very, very unlikely, respectively,” he said. “But this research gives a false sense of rigor. Tomorrow someone could invent a carbon-free energy source that everyone adopts. “If you look at technology adoption and action taken on the ozone layer and acid rain, it’s clear these things can change faster than people predict.” Dessler said the falling cost of renewable energy would be a major factor in reducing emissions but further impetus would be needed through new actions such as a price on carbon.  “It’s like you’re driving and about to collide with the car in front of you,” he said. “You want to hit the brakes as fast as you can. The later you wait, the more painful it’s going to be.”John Sterman, an academic at the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative, said the research was an “urgent call to action”. MIT research has shown that emissions cuts in the Paris agreement would stave off around 1C of temperature increase by 2100 – findings misrepresented by Trump when he announced the US departure from the pact.Sterman said the US must “dramatically speed the deployment of renewable energy and especially energy efficiency. Fortunately, renewables, storage and other technologies are already cheaper than fossil energy in many places and costs are falling fast.“More aggressive policies are urgently needed, but this study should not be taken as evidence that nothing can be done.”"

Playwright, director and actor Sam Shepard has died at the age of 73.The Pulitzer prize winner died of complications from ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neurone disease) at his home in Kentucky on 30 July surrounded by family. Shepard had written 44 plays including Buried Child, which won him the Pulitzer prize for drama in 1979. He also received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor for his role in The Right Stuff.Shepard started writing plays in the 60s. “Back then, there was a dearth of American theatre,” he told the Observer in 2014. “There was nothing going on. American art was starving.”His work included Angel City, Cowboy Mouth (in collaboration with Patti Smith that was written in just two nights) and a screenplay for Wim Wenders’ Paris, Texas. He received Tony nominations for both Buried Child and a 2000 revival of True West.Shepard also directed many of his plays but with rare exceptions, he refrained from directing work of others. He directed two films: 1988’s Far North with then-partner Jessica Lange and 1993’s Silent Tongue, which starred Richard Harris and River Phoenix.He also collaborated with Bob Dylan for the song Brownsville Girl which featured on his 1986 album Knocked Out Loaded. As an actor, his first notable role was in Terrence Malick’s Days of Heaven in 1978. He went on to star in Baby Boom, Steel Magnolias, The Pelican Brief, Black Hawk Down, The Notebook and August: Osage County. He was most recently seen in the Netflix drama Bloodline, alongside Sissy Spacek.He was known as an acclaimed character actor rather than an A-lister, a route he chose early in his career. “I had all kinds of wild offers at that time to be a movie star and I panicked,” he later said. “I was turning down things like Warren Beatty’s Reds, that part of Eugene O’Neill [played by Jack Nicholson]. My agent was going crazy. I hadn’t realized what the experience of it would be like – to be on the verge of being a movie star. Because it’s like you are the hottest whore in town. Everybody wants you.”When asked about his performances on stage, he said he wasn’t quite as comfortable as on screen. “You don’t have to do anything in the movies,” he said in an interview with the New York Times. “You just sit there. Well, that’s not entirely true. You do less. I find the whole situation of confronting an audience terrifying.”Before his death, he completed a role in the psychological thriller Never Here with Mireille Enos. This year also saw the release of his book The One Inside, a series of conversations with himself. He is survived by three children.Figures from both stage and screen have paid tribute to Shepard on Twitter. Writer Beau Willimon referred to him as “fearless” and “one of the greats”, Harlan Coben tweeted: “How special was he? Even when you didn’t like something he’d done, you were glad you saw it” and Reese Witherspoon called him “a truly original actor and an incredible writer”."

The Canadian government is investigating reports that Saudi Arabia is using armoured vehicles made in Canada against its own civilians – allegations that have prompted renewed scrutiny over Ottawa’s recent decision to sign off on a billion-dollar arms deal with the kingdom.Videos and photos posted on social media in recent days allegedly show Riyadh using Canadian equipment in a violent crackdown on minority Shia dissidents in eastern Saudi Arabia. Last week at least five people were killed as security forces flushed out suspected militants in the town of Awamiya. Several sources told the Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail that the vehicles being used appeared to be Gurkha RPVs made in Ontario by Terradyne Armoured Vehicles. Canadian officials said they were deeply concerned by the reports. “We are looking at these claims very seriously … and have immediately launched a review,” Justin Trudeau told reporters. In 2016, Saudi Arabia ranked among the largest importers of Canada-made military goods, purchasing more than C$142m worth of goods – nearly 20% of all Canadian military exports that year.The ministry of global affairs said it was concerned over the escalating violence in eastern Saudi Arabia. In a statement issued last week, it highlighted the causalities among civilians and security forces and urged Riyadh to confront its security challenges in “a manner that abides by international human rights law”.Days later, the ministry said the government was actively seeking more information about the reports of civilian casualties and claims that Canadian-made vehicles were involved. “If it is found that Canadian exports have been used to commit serious violations of human rights, the minister will take action,” a spokesperson for department told the Guardian. He did not answer questions around what kinds of actions this could entail. Terradyne Armoured Vehicles did not respond to a request for comment. The allegations have prompted renewed calls for Trudeau’s Liberal government to scrap a recent decision to push forward with a 15-year contract to supply Saudi Arabia with weaponised armoured vehicles made by General Dynamics, another Ontario-based company. Critics say the C$15bn deal, struck in 2014 by the previous conservative government, could see the vehicles – which are equipped with machine guns – used by the Saudis to crush dissent at home. Others have pointed to Canadian rules that restrict arms exports to countries with poor human rights records and prohibit exports if there is a possibility that the buyer could use the arms against its own population. Despite these concerns, Trudeau’s Liberal government signed off on the export permits in 2016. Trudeau has since defended the decision, arguing that Canada would be seen as a “banana republic” if it scrapped the deal. “People have to know that when you sign a deal with Canada, a change in governments won’t immediately scrap the jobs and benefits coming from it,” the prime minister told the Toronto Star last year. The deal would reportedly create around 3,000 jobs in Canada. Amid escalating concerns over human rights, countries such as Germany and Belgium have in recent years denied export applications for arms headed to Saudi Arabia. In 2015, Sweden cancelled a longstanding defence agreement with the Saudis, citing similar concerns. This month, a high court in London ruled that the UK could proceed with arms sales to Saudi Arabia. “Saudi Arabia has been, and remains, genuinely committed to compliance with International Humanitarian Law; and there was no ‘real risk’ that there might be ‘serious violations’ of International Humanitarian Law (in its various manifestations) such that UK arm sales to Saudi Arabia should be suspended or cancelled,” the court said. Campaigners called the ruling a “green light” for the UK to sell arms to “brutal dictatorships and human rights abusers”.In Canada, Amnesty International pointed to the indications that Canadian vehicles are being used against civilians to call on the Liberal government to reverse its support of the billion-dollar arms deal.“Mounting tensions and conflict in eastern Saudi Arabia, about which the Canadian government has rightly expressed public concern, further indicate how fraught it is for Canada to have authorised the sale of light armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia at this time,” secretary-general Alex Neve said in a statement.

19,"US President Donald Trump personally dictated a misleading statement which his son Donald Trump Jr delivered on his meeting with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential election campaign, according to a Washington Post report. In his statement, Trump Jr said he discussed the adoption of Russian children with the lawyer who had offered damaging information on Hillary Clinton.","

Donald Trump personally dictated the press statement issued in the name of his eldest son Donald Jr that misleadingly downplayed the significance of a 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer, a new report alleged on Monday night.According to the Washington Post, Trump personally intervened to prevent senior White House advisers from issuing a full and truthful account of the meeting on 9 June 2016 in which Donald Trump Jr, the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and then presidential campaign manager Paul Manafort came face-to-face with four Russians. One of the Russian visitors was the well-connected lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.The report, based on multiple though largely anonymous sources that included the president’s own advisers, has the potential to cause political, and even legal, trouble for the White House because it draws Trump himself much closer into the fray over the Trump Tower meeting, which has become a lightning rod in the Russian affair.Shunning the guidance of lawyers and overturning the view apparently reached by Kushner and his team of advisers that a full and frank accounting should be made, Trump reportedly dictated a statement on board Air Force One as he was flying back to Washington from the G20 summit in Germany. As would soon become apparent, it gave a very partial and distorted account of events.In the release the 2016 meeting was presented, in Trump’s own words, as “a short introductory meeting” dominated by discussion of the adoption of Russian children that was “not a campaign issue at the time”.That statement was presented to the New York Times on 8 July, and duly included in the newspaper’s first account of the meeting. But within 24 hours, highly damaging revelations had emerged that made clear the meeting had been much more charged than that.On 9 July, the Times revealed that Trump Jr had been lured into talking to Veselnitskaya by the promise of negative intelligence on his father’s presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, and two days after that the email chain was published that showed the younger Trump reveling in the idea of receiving dirt on the Democratic presidential candidate, uttering the gleeful phrase: “I love it”.The Trump Tower meeting has proved to be one of the most toxic pieces of information to emerge so far in the billowing investigation into possible ties between Trump associates and Russia in the Kremlin’s efforts to skew the presidential outcome in favor of the Republican nominee. The special counsel leading the investigation, Robert Mueller, is understood to be looking closely at the event and has reportedly asked the White House to preserve all documents relating to it.Until now, the president managed to keep some distance from the 9 June encounter, with his lawyers claiming that he knew nothing about it. But the new report that Trump personally oversaw the issuing of a misleading account of the proceedings raises questions about the president’s role in what could be conceived as a cover-up.It comes as Mueller has already expanded his inquiry to include the issue of whether Trump was engaging in a possible obstruction of justice when he fired James Comey, having tried and failed to persuade the then director of the FBI to back off investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s contacts with Russian officials.A lawyer for the president issued the Washington Post with a curt statement: “Apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent,” Jay Sekulow said.The new details of the president’s role in what turned out to be a major communications fiasco come on the day that his current communications chief, Anthony Scaramucci, was dismissed from the White House after barely 11 days. The blunt removal was made on the first day of the new White House chief of staff, John Kelly, who has vowed to introduce the kind of discipline that the West Wing has been sorely lacking.The day began shortly before 5.30am with Trump tweeting “No WH chaos!” and ended with him saying: “A great day at the White House”. But as the Washington Post’s forensic deconstruction of the framing of the Trump Tower meeting shows, the president himself has the capacity to destroy even the best-laid plans, underlining the task now facing his new chief of staff.According to the Post, senior White House officials together with the circle around Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, had spent days rehearsing various ways to address the Trump Tower meeting publicly.Kushner’s team was reported to have decided that it was better to “err on the side of transparency” because the whole truth would eventually come out.Trump, however, appeared to have seen things differently."

That brings our coverage of the AHRC’s landmark survey to a close.Here are the report’s main points:Submissions from survivors themselves told us how:Universities have promised to implement the report’s recommendations, but given how vocal advocates have been of past “institutional failures”, the strength of their response and the timeline of implementation will be something to keep an eye on.Updated

Here’s a final submission from someone who used to work as a residential tutor, who contacted Guardian Australia anonymously to share their story:I was working in one of the residential colleges as a member of the staff, and was supporting a student through a case of sexual assault. It was escalated to the university and an internal investigation was conducted (I was not involved in the investigation, but sat in during the interviews). Basically, it was a case of the student’s word against the perpetrator’s and therefore the university concluded that there was not enough evidence to take any action. Based on our experience and from the testimonies given by both sides, my colleagues at the college who were involved in supporting the student and I knew that the victim’s account is more likely to be true than not, but we could not do anything without proof. And because the report came back without any conclusive result, we could not take any official action against the perpetrator. It was frustrating and I felt that we had truly let the victim down. To make it worse, the victim and the alleged perpetrator had to remain staying in the same college till the end of the year.Updated

“The universities often actually make it worse”Here’s a video from Fair Agenda featuring speakers from End Rape on Campus, Hunting Ground Australia and student councils. They speak a bit more about how university processes let students down, either by acting too slowly or not at all. As we’ve seen in the report, there are a number of barriers that contribute to the “damning statistic” that only 4% of students believe their universities are doing enough.Updated

Here’s some more on methodology. The End Rape On Campus ambassador, Nina Funnell, has criticised the final report for scaling back its own sample size from an earlier census-esque proposal.The original survey was planned for all 1.3 million Australian university students but was reduced and only sent to 300,000, according to Funnell. Of those 300,000, only 31,000 answered. “Perhaps the response rate would have been higher had the AHRC not trusted universities to select when to send the survey out,” she said.“Left to their own devices many of the universities sent the survey out during student exams when students have more pressing concerns.”Updated

“In a lecture theatre of 100 students, two have been sexually assaulted.”Here’s the sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, talking through the report’s findings this morning.She said one in five students had been sexually harassed in a university setting last year, with women twice as likely as men to be sexually harassed and three times as likely to be sexually assaulted.It’s also worth noting that Jenkin’s hypothetical lecture theatre example only counts on-campus incidents of assault. If we count all incidents, that number rises to seven students out of 100, and one in 10 for female students.Updated

Today’s report has been criticised by some advocates for implying that universities only have an obligation to deal with incidents that happen in a university setting – either on campus or at a university event. But the co-women’s officer at the University of Sydney, Imogen Grant, told Guardian Australia today that assaults that occur outside of university grounds can still be reported to universities because they involve student perpetrators.She says we should keep in mind that student offenders can be disciplined by their university: Most incidents of assault occur around the broader university community, in share houses and at social events.But the perpetrators are still fellow students. And if the perpetrator is a fellow student, you can report that to the university and you can expect disciplinary action as well.It’s also an issue raised by End Rape On Campus ambassador Nina Funnell, who said in today’s media conference that the report’s 10-point plan had no recommendations for improving disciplinary proceedings against offenders. In response, the chair of Universities Australia, Prof Margaret Gardner, said she had “begun a conversation” with universities about new misconduct proceedings. Here’s a submission from the report itself that claims this issue has been overlooked:A woman who was sexually assaulted on numerous occasions by her intimate partner, a fellow university student, was told the university had “no power to do anything, because none of it occurred on-campus”.She felt that the university should have taken action, because she was aware of the perpetrator sexually assaulting at least two other women at her university.

Calla WahlquistAt some point in the pub crawl, usually on the walk between pubs two and three, one of the guys at the front of the group would tip their head back and start singing: “I wish all the women.”It’s a classic rhyming song, where the lead singer makes observations like, ‘I wish all the women/were waves in the ocean/and if I was a surfer/I’d ride them with my motion,’ and everybody else sings it back. By the train ride home even the most devoted singers would have run out of verses and switched to ‘Beastiality is best’. The hook is everybody chanting: “Beastiality is best, boys, beastiality is best. Fuck a wallaby!”My two years living at a residential college at an Australian university were some 10 years ago now, so I can only remember what we were supposed to do to an owl.Details about the culture of sexual harassment and prevalence sexual assault at residential colleges contained in the AHRC report were appalling, but they did not surprise me. That’s just O-week. We had a golden bed springs award. I liked living at college. I was new to the city and did not know anyone and at college I had ready-made friends, some of whom remain close friends now. It’s only later that you think about what happened and realise it’s not normal. The Eagle Rock thing? We did that. There was a weekly newsletter about who had slept with who. Everyone told rape jokes. We drank so much we couldn’t move. People who did not join in were ostracised. I remember one occasion where a woman from another hall said she had been raped from a male from our hall. The universal judgment was that she was a slut, she was just making it up. Women did that all the time, didn’t they?Updated

As mentioned earlier today, only 9% of students who had been sexually assaulted on their campus reported the attack to their university. Here are some examples, in survivors’ own words, of why they decided not to pursue the perpetrators of their assault or harassment. Multiple submissions said they were deterred by their university’s failure to provide anonymous reporting:Our cohort for our course is incredibly small. I felt too scared to report these incidents. I couldn’t have action taken against him because everyone would find out.Another student had their identity disclosed to their rapist’s friends: The university broke confidentiality by informing organisers of the camp (i.e: the rapist’s friends) what I’d done. People spread lies about me and I was ostracised from the club.Another said the university forced them into a process of face-to-face “mediation” with their harasser:When I complained to the head of school I had a “mediation” session with the professor who was harassing me ... he stormed out and slammed the door. He wasn’t told to change his behaviour, the “mediation session” was all that was done.For many respondents there was always an underlying social pressure not to report, stemming from a fear of being ridiculed, ostracised or shamed for not doing enough. Said one: It was my word against his. He’s known as being a really nice friendly guy so I didn’t think a lot of people would believe me or care.Updated

Residential colleges at Australian universities are full of students from regional and remote areas, as well as international students, many of whom are living away from home for the first time. They’re usually co-ed.They’re also one of the highest risk places on campus for sexual assault and sexual harassment, according to the AHRC survey. Twelve per cent of women and 3% of men who were sexually assaulted at a university in 2015 and 2016 said it had occurred at a residential college.The report found that hazing practices at colleges often involved excessive alcohol consumption and humiliating or degrading acts, “and, in many cases, sexual harassment and sexual assault”.According to one submission:The aim is to get the freshers as drunk as possible. Maybe a secondary aim is to make them look as ridiculous and embarrassing as possible, giving them costumes, props, and even sometimes smearing food all over them.Said another:You had to participate, there was nothing you could do about it. The administration knew about this and they condoned this. The students had no power whatsoever, you couldn’t say anything. Hazing practices described in the report included getting female students to “run the gauntlet”, which meant running down a hallway where male students stood in every doorway with the nozzle of a cask of wine sticking out their fly. Female students were required to kneel before each male resident and “drink from his sack”.Another college had a ritual where all first-year female students had to remove their top when a certain song was played. They would be surrounded by male students and unable to leave the dance floor with their top still on. Other submissions described year-round traditions that focused on residents’ sexual exploits.Conquests of guys getting girls from other colleges were broadcasted weekly in this gossip session the whole college had, where you would submit your experiences to an executive, and on weeknights we would gather and hear about everyone’s conquests that week ... women were described as objects or trophies. The report also found that power relationships between resident advisers – usually senior students – and first-year students, as well as the close proximity created by living in residential colleges and the easy access to both alcohol and bedrooms, were contributing factors in the high rates of sexual assault.

Dutch police have arrested five men suspected of stealing €500,000 (£448,000) of iPhones in a dangerous late-night heist from a moving truck akin to action scenes from Fast and Furious.Dutch police said that the five men, aged from 33 to 43 and all from Romania, allegedly raided a delivery truck full of iPhones on the A73 highway near Horst on the night of 24 July. Using a modified van, they drove close enough to the back of the truck to allow one of the suspects to climb onto it and break in through the doors while it was being driven down the road.The suspect then passed boxes of Apple’s iPhone from the delivery truck into the modified van through a hole in its roof.Dutch police spokesman Ed Kraszewski said that officers had long been investigating thefts from trucks but had remained sceptical that such a heist could be pulled off. Not any more.Kraszewski said: “The truck was taking its freight from A to B and did not stop. Even so, [the phones] were gone. So it must have happened that way. And now we finally have the evidence, with the van and the loot.”The five men were arrested at a holiday park in the central Netherlands on Saturday. Police recovered the iPhones and the van they believe was used in the heist. The suspects are to appear Tuesday before an investigating judge.Kraszewski said similar raids had been reported elsewhere in Europe, almost always targeting high-end smartphones, but that there had been no arrests until now. The thieves are accused of being responsible for emptying 17 trucks of expensive goods since 2015, according to local reports.Romanian police released a video, shot from a police helicopter of a similar raid from 2012, where thieves drove up behind a truck using an angle grinder to break open the doors and steal goods while other members of the gang held-back traffic in other cars.Dutch police will send the fingerprints of the suspects to colleagues around Europe to check for potential matches to previous crimes."

Archaeologists have unearthed a large, centuries-old statue that is believed to have once stood guard over an ancient hospital at Cambodia’s famed Angkor temple complex.The nearly two metre tall carving, which is thought to be from the late 12th to the early 13th century, was discovered during a dig on Saturday, said Long Kosal, a spokesman for Apsara Authority – the state agency charged with managing the complex. The Angkor Archeological Park, a world heritage site, contains the remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire, dating from the 9th to the 15th centuries, and is Cambodia’s most popular tourist destination.At the height of its power the city and its hundreds of temples boasted more than a million inhabitants, making it one of the world’s most populous pre-industrial centres. Huge swathes of the park have been excavated over the decades, creating a walkable archaeological wonder that attracts more than two million visitors a year. But the complex remains a treasure trove for yet to be discovered finds. Cambodian archaeologists and experts from Singapore’s Institute of Southeast Asian Studies found the statue buried 40 centimeters under the ground during an excavation of an Angkor-era hospital built during the reign of King Jayavarman VII.The Apsara agency said the sandstone statue’s arms and legs had broken off but the carving on the body and head “remain beautiful” despite the passage of time. They said the statue was likely to have been a symbolic guardian of the hospital. "

A pub which holds the record for being the highest in the UK is going on for sale for £900,000.The 17th-century Tan Hill Inn in the Yorkshire Dales stands 1,732 ft (528m) above sea level. It was named the highest in the Britain by the Guinness Book of World Records in 1976, beating the Cat and Fiddle Inn in the Peak District with an elevation of 1,690 feet (515m).The listed building, which boasts panoramic views of the surrounding area, is regularly cut off by heavy snowfall and current landlady Louise Peace said she had been snowed in about 50 times, for between three and 11 days, since she bought it with her husband in 2005.A “solitary inn” was noted to stand on the same spot on the Pennine Way in a 1586 guide book and the location near the village of Keld in Swaledale is popular with walkers hoping to see glimpses of the Northern Lights.Peace said the new owner of the pub would need to have stamina, eccentricity and love. “It needs a nice family network, it’s a fantastic place, it needs a family that can pass it on to the next generation,” she told local media. “It warms your cockles, it’s an amazing place.“It’s like having a child. You love it and nurture it, then it’s time for them to move on and you wish them all the best. You can’t not love Tan Hill. You can’t not miss it, you really can’t. It’s in your blood. But I still have to say ‘cheerio’ and let someone else take it on to the next level.”Peace, who is giving up the business to go and join her husband Mike at their retirement home in Somerset, said she had already had inquiries from potential buyers.In 2009, people celebrating New Year’s Eve at the Tan Hill Inn were stranded there for three days following a heavy snowfall. In November last year, the band Scouting For Girls were cut off along with around 200 others after playing a Children in Need gig at the pub. Guests were forced to squeeze into the inn’s 30 rooms, with many sleeping on sofas and floors."

The Hungarian Grand Prix could yet stand as one of the defining moments of the 2017 Formula One season.Under the unyielding sun of a Budapest summer the two title protagonists, who have been equally unforgiving on track in a battle that has swayed gloriously between them, finally showed their hands as to how that fight would proceed in the second half of the season.Sebastian Vettel won what was hardly a classic race but Lewis Hamilton, in standing by his team-mate, admitted he might have dropped points that could ultimately cost him the world championship.Vettel won at the Hungaroring with an impressive drive from pole position. That he did so while nursing a damaged steering wheel made it all the more of an achievement but also put the Scuderia on the spot.His team-mate Kimi Raikkonen was quicker on track but they chose not to order Vettel to allow him to pass. That the German is their only title contender could not have been clearer.In their wake Hamilton was on a charge and in turn faster than his team‑mate Valtteri Bottas. With passing at the Hungaroring all but impossible this year, he asked Mercedes to tell Bottas to let him through to chase down the leading Ferraris, agreeing that he would give the place back should he fail to overtake them. Bottas let him through and, unable to pass Raikkonen and seven seconds up the road from his team-mate, Hamilton duly gave back the place on the final lap. Raikkonen held second, with Bottas in third and Hamilton fourth.The British driver now trails Vettel by 14 points in the world championship and ceding the place cost him three. With the title fight likely to go to the wire it might yet prove to have been the sportsmanlike gesture that could deny him a fourth drivers’ title this year.“I want to win the championship the right way,” he said. “I don’t know whether that will come back to bite me on the backside or not but I said at the beginning of the year, I want to win it the right way. I do think today was the right way to do things.”Ferrari have a long history of imposing team orders and designating a No1 driver but the Mercedes executive director, Toto Wolff, agreed with Hamilton and drew a stark comparison with how his team and the Scuderia went racing.“We have seen the backlash from decisions that were ruthless and cold blooded and the effect that it had on the brand,” he said. “You could say: ‘Screw it, it still won them the championship, who cares? They are in the history books.’ But I do not think that is the right spin and if the purpose of us being here is to do the right things and win in the right way – sometimes doing it the right way and standing by your values is tough and it was today, believe me.”Giving the place back was no easy feat. Bottas was only just in front of the Red Bull of Max Verstappen and there was a real danger the manoeuvre could have cost Hamilton two places. The team had debated whether it should be done but were clear Hamilton was not instructed to do so and that he was merely sticking to his word.“It was very sportsmanlike behaviour,” said Wolff, who also acknowledged that it could cost Hamilton the title. “These values won us six championships and it will make us win more championships in years to come. It cost us three points and could cost us the championship and we are perfectly conscious of that. But in terms of how the drivers and this team operates, we stick to what we say and if the consequences are as much as losing the championship, then we will take it.”There was little doubt that Vettel deserved the 25 points, both he and Raikkonen having a pace advantage in the early stage over Mercedes. But he revealed he was wrestling with his damaged car from the off. “I felt there was something not right on the grid and for the formation lap the steering wheel was not straight,” he said.“Then it got worse and towards the end of the stint it was more difficult. We spoke on the radio about it and I was told to avoid the kerbs but on this track you use them on every corner, so you lose speed. It was good that it is tricky to overtake here. It felt like a very long race.”Ferrari have not won the constructors’ championship since 2008 and have not taken the drivers’ title since Raikkonen claimed it in 2007. Their step forward to go head-to head with Mercedes this season gives them a real opportunity to end the drought.Raikkonen might have been passed by Hamilton, which would have cost them constructor points, but they opted to gamble on the British driver being unable to do so. It paid off and they can consider their strategy a success but it indicated that they were willing to risk the team championship in favour of backing Vettel for the title.Maurizio Arrivabene, Ferrari’s team principal, praised Raikkonen for being a “true team player” and Sergio Marchionne, the Ferrari chief executive, admitted the result had come as a relief. “It was a much‑needed win,” he said. “The great thing is we earned it, this was a tough, tough race and we almost lost it and we got it back.”Vettel holds the lead going into the summer break and he has earned it but Hamilton can also rest easy knowing that he held an honourable line in Hungary. “The team were in a difficult position but I think today really shows, hopefully, that I am a man of my word,” he said."

","Children were seen clinging to parents as they dangled 40 metres above the river RhineUp to 76 people were rescued from cable cars suspended over the river Rhine in Cologne on Sunday afternoon after a gondola crashed into a support pillar, leaving passengers stranded. German fire crews lowered people to safety from cable cars in a dramatic recovery operation, with children seen clinging to parents as they dangled 40 metres above the river. German media reported that rescue teams in Cologne had practised for an incident on the gondola just a week ago.A pregnant woman and a man were slightly injured in the rescue mission in which mobile cranes were used to bring the stranded passengers to safety. No other injuries were reported.Public transportation authorities for the city in North-Rhine-Westphalia state said 32 gondolas were operating when the incident occurred. An official cause has not been announced, but there was strong wind at the time. Martina and Hans-Peter Rieger, the first to be rescued, were celebrating their 41st wedding anniversary on a day out in Cologne when the cable cars stopped. “That will always be in our memory,” Mr Rieger said. “Fortunately, we were given hand signals to tell us we should remain calm and the incident was nothing bad.”Emergency services from Aachen and Dusseldorf assisted fire crews with the rescue.  Henriette Reker, the mayor of Cologne, said: “I would like to thank the Cologne fire brigade for their great dedication. This meant that the passengers could be rescued quickly. My thoughts were with the children and adults, who had to wait courageously and patiently for many hours.“ The cable cars in Cologne are a popular means of transport, connecting the zoo to the Rheinpark across the river. The system remained close on Sunday evening as officials worked to establish the cause. "
31,"UFC light heavyweight world champion Daniel Cormier lost his title to Jon Jones after getting knocked out by a head kick in third round at UFC 214. Following the loss, the 38-year-old broke down and was also seen crying on his coach's shoulders. It was Cormier's second loss of his MMA career, with the first also having come against Jones.","Associated Press

Jon Jones had barely reclaimed his UFC title when he called out Brock Lesnar to be his next opponent.And Lesnar was listening.Right after Jones stopped Daniel Cormier in the third round at UFC 214 on Saturday, he reignited his growing rivalry with Lesnar, the former UFC heavyweight champion.“Brock Lesnar, if you want to know what it feels like to get your ass kicked by a guy who weighs 40 pounds less than you, meet me in the octagon,” Jones said on the pay-per-view broadcast.The Associated Press reached Lesnar shortly after he watched the championship fight and then heard Jones call him out.“Be careful what you wish for, young man,” Lesnar replied.A heavyweight superfight between Jones and Lesnar would be one of the biggest events in UFC history. Lesnar is an extraordinary pay-per-view draw as likely the most popular fighter in mixed martial arts, while Jones’ victory over Cormier is expected to put him back atop most pound-for-pound lists as the world’s best fighter.Lesnar returned to MMA last year with a victory, but he is under contract to the WWE as a professional wrestler until next spring.Jones and Lesnar traded verbal jabs earlier in the week. After Jones said he doubted Lesnar would ever accept a fight with him, Lesnar told the AP that he would meet Jones “anytime, anywhere.”Lesnar is at least considering a return to the sport in which he won a UFC title in just his fourth professional fight.UFC president Dana White was in the cage when Jones called out Lesnar, and the promotion is aware of the growing buzz surrounding the matchup. White is also aware of the obstacles in its way, including the remainder of Lesnar’s suspension for failing a doping test last year.“It’s fun to talk about, but the reality of it happening anytime soon, it’s not a reality,” White said.But it’s definitely a lucrative possibility if Lesnar decides to resume training for MMA. Jones is the light heavyweight champion, but has long contemplated a move up to heavyweight – and his post-fight comments make it clear that he’s interested.Lesnar beat Mark Hunt at UFC 200 in a unanimous decision that was changed to a no-contest after the failed test. He received a one-year suspension from the Nevada Athletic Commission, but could return to MMA after completing the final months of the ban."

Well that’s all from me, thanks for reading. I’ll leave you with our initial race report:

9.56am EDT
09:56

Sebastian Vettel throws his trophy into the air. He now leads Lewis Hamilton by 14 points in the drivers’ championship. “It was a really difficult race,” says Vettel. “I had my hands full. The steering was off. I had to stay focused for the whole race.” Here’s the race classification:INITIAL CLASSIFICATION (LAP 71/71): A win on his 50th Ferrari start for Sebastian Vettel 👏 #HungarianGP 🇭🇺 #F1 pic.twitter.com/FnGuEQBNeXUpdated

Vettel celebrates on top of his Ferrari, punching the air before throwing himself into the mechanics in red. He will enjoy the world championship lead for the next four weeks.Updated
at 9.56am EDT


9.45am EDT
09:45

Hamilton finishes fourth, then, with Verstappen fifth and Alonso a brilliant sixth – he finished with the fastest lap of the race, not bad in that McLaren Honda. 

9.44am EDT
09:44

Vettel has Kimi Raikkonen looming large in his mirrors but holds on to win the race, with his team-mate second ahead of Lewis Hamilton in third – no, he allows Bottas back through right at the very last.Updated
at 9.58am EDT


9.42am EDT
09:42

Lap 69/70 Mercedes haven’t been able to swap Hamilton and Bottas back, an unlikely bonus for the Briton and his championship hopes.

9.40am EDT
09:40

Lap 68/70 Vettel is closing in on another grand prix victory and 25 valuable championship points. He had a worry with those steering issues earlier and put his team-mate under pressure in the process, but they are nearing a crucial Ferrari one-two. 

9.39am EDT
09:39

Lap 67/70 McLaren, by the way, are on the verge of sealing sixth and 10th positions, a very good result. Alonso has clear air and he’s enjoying himself, setting one of the fastest laps of the race. Updated
at 9.42am EDT


9.37am EDT
09:37

Lap 66/70 Mercedes are now the ones with a decision to make. They had promised Bottas they would return him to third, after he let Hamilton through earlier. But there is a gap of five seconds between them and Verstappen is flying up behind in the Red Bull. It’s been some race from the Dutch driver considering his ten-second penalty. 

9.34am EDT
09:34

Lap 64/70 “We’re going to have to retire the car,” Paul di Resta is told. That’s a shame for Felipe Massa’s stand-in who had been enjoying a steady race in his first taste of the Williams car. 

9.33am EDT
09:33

Lap 63/70 Magnussen jams past Hulkenberg and Kvyat aggressively and up to 11th as he chases a championship point. Vettel has opened up a slightly wider gap, now around two seconds. He seems to be over whatever he was struggling with through the middle part of this race.

9.30am EDT
09:30

Lap 61/70 Vettel continues to muddle on, but the turbulent air he’s kicking up is preventing Raikkonen from successfully closing the gap. Hamilton is suffering the same issue, it seems. He tells Mercedes he is waiting for a mistake. The top ten:1 Vettel 2 Raikkonen +1.53 Hamilton +1.04 Bottas +5.35 Verstappen +3.56 Alonso +53.27 Sainz +6.38 Perez +1.49 Ocon +4.310 Vandoorne +4.1

9.27am EDT
09:27

Lap 58/70 What a situation Ferrari have got themselves into as we approach the final 12 laps. Vettel, Raikkonen and Hamilton remain only two seconds apart. Raikkonen has stepped off a little, conscious that he is going to wear out his tyres if he keeps trying to close down his team-mate. Hamilton is struggling to get any closer to the Ferraris, though, despite the aid of DRS. 

9.23am EDT
09:23

Lap 55/70 The Ferraris are approaching the backmarkers of Magnussen and Hulkenberg, who themselves are scrapping for 11th. They move through the traffic in one of the trickiest parts of the track, the third and final sector approaching the long pitstraight. As Vettel crosses the line he’s only 0.7 seconds ahead of Raikkonen, who is 0.7 seconds up on Hamilton. Bottas can’t keep up right now. 

9.20am EDT
09:20

Lap 53/70 Hamilton is chasing Raikkonen, but the Fin is lining up a pass of his own as he attacks Vettel, who continues to struggle a little. He’s within DRS range and these two Ferraris are running round the Hungaroring in close convoy. 

9.17am EDT
09:17

Lap 52/70 Hamilton has been told he’s got five laps to get the job done on Raikkonen. Game on. “No pressure then,” Hamilton responds.

9.16am EDT
09:16

Hamilton needs to get results soon or he’ll be given a team order he won’t much enjoy:LAP 50: 📻 ""Lewis will let you go by if he can't get past Raikkonen.""#Teamwork 💪 #F1

9.15am EDT
09:15

Lap 49/70 Hulkenberg is having a terrible pit stop. Smoke appears to be billowing from his front left tyre, and as he pulls away he seems very unsure of whether his car is still road-worthy. Up ahead, Hamilton is attacking Raikkonen – he’s 1.1 seconds down. Raikkonen is 1.1 seconds behind Vettel as it bunches up at the front. Raikkonen is continuing to complain on radio that he should be allowed to pass his team-mate. “Vettel is being told to push, stay with him,” respond Ferrari. 

9.11am EDT
09:11

Lap 47/70 Mercedes give the order and Valtteri Bottas pulls wide to allow Hamilton to pass. He sets his sights on Raikkonen and puts the hammer down, immediately setting an absurd fastest first sector.

9.09am EDT
09:09

Lap 45/70 Lewis Hamilton on radio to Mercedes, in teenager mode. “OK man, look, I’ve got a lot of pace. Let me use it. And this radio stuff sucks, my tyres were fine. I didn’t need to come in.”

9.06am EDT
09:06

Lap 43/70 Max Verstappen comes in, serves his 10-second penalty, puts on some fresh shoes and shuffles back out in fifth position behind the Ferraris and Mercedes.

9.04am EDT
09:04

Lap 41/70 An interesting situation has developed at the front. Vettel is struggling and behind him Raikkonen is putting in quick times. Raikkonen wants to be let through to have a go at winning this race, but Vettel is their only championship hope and they don’t want to leave him vulnerable to the two Mercedes chasing. Ferrari HQ has a major decision to make. Updated
at 9.17am EDT


9.00am EDT
09:00

Lap 39/70 Verstappen, the only one of the initial top six not to have stopped, is actually leading this race by 10.6 seconds, so even his 10-second time penalty can’t take that away from him. He’ll be in shortly. 

8.58am EDT
08:58

Lap 37/70 Sergio Perez brings that garish Force India into the pits but it’s a pretty poor one and he’s lost some time. Next Alonso is in. He is desperate to get in and out ahead of Sainz, almost colliding with his young Spanish counterpart on exit. A battle ensues as they emerge on to the circuit but Sainz holds on to ninth spot, Alonso running off and on again in his eagerness to pass. 

8.54am EDT
08:54

Lap 34/70 Vettel’s pit stop is a little sluggish. Next comes Raikkonen. First he sounds off over radio, telling backmarker Paul di Resta to “get back in the commentary box”. He stops, comes out and nearly holds off his Ferrari team-mate, but not quite. Updated
at 9.05am EDT


8.51am EDT
08:51

Lap 32/70 “Fronts are not in a healthy shape,” says Vettel. “Don’t extend it.” He wants to come in. Hamilton does stop and Mercedes get through it nearly a second quicker than his team-mate’s change of tyres. He returns fifth, such was the huge gap to Carlos Sainz before he came in. 

8.49am EDT
08:49

Lap 31/70 Despite the issue with his steering wheel, Vettel seems comfortable enough to continue leading the way, though Raikkonen has closed that gap down from nearly two seconds. Now the stops start: Bottas comes in for Mercedes, a slightly slow one. Updated
at 10.09am EDT


8.47am EDT
08:47

Lap 30/70 Vettel overtakes Ericsson, the first backmarker. Here’s the top ten:1 Vettel2 Raikkonen +1.23 Bottas +6.64 Verstappen +2.65 Hamilton +1.56 Sainz +22.77 Alonso +1.48 Perez +3.19 Vandoorne +3.410 Ocon +4.5

8.44am EDT
08:44

Lap 27/70 We are heading towards the part of the race when we should see a flurry of stops. The supersoft tyre (which most drivers have started with) is significantly quicker than the soft around the Hungaroring, though it doesn’t last nearly as long. There could well be some undercut opportunities here. Meanwhile: “The steering is hanging to the left when I go straight,” complains Sebastian Vettel. “And I think it’s getting worse.”

8.40am EDT
08:40

Lap 24/70 Grosjean’s race is over. He can’t get his crawling car back to the pits and he pulls up to become the second retirement of this race. 

8.39am EDT
08:39

Lap 23/70 Well it should have been a long stint. “OK slow down, bring it back,” Haas say on radio. “I think we have a crossed wheel nut.” A replay shows a mechanic give the F1 signal for a crossed wheel nut, holding his arms in the air like he’s just signed for West Ham, only with much sadder eyes.Updated
at 8.40am EDT


8.36am EDT
08:36

Lap 22/70 The front five are well clear of the rest with about 15 seconds splitting Vettel in first and Hamilton in fifth. Further back down the road, Grosjean pits from 16th after suffering a dip in right-rear tyre pressure. He puts on the soft tyre which will set him up for a long stint. 

8.33am EDT
08:33

Lap 20/70 Hulkenberg has been given a free pass by Jolyon Palmer, his Renault team-mate. The Briton started 10th but has slipped back to 12th. 

8.31am EDT
08:31

Lap 19/70 Hamilton, in fifth, has upped his pace in the past couple of laps, setting the fastest opening sector of the race and opening a gap between his Mercedes and the Toro Rosso of Sainz behind him of around 12 seconds – the biggest in the race. Updated
at 8.34am EDT


8.29am EDT
08:29

Lap 17/70 Here’s a huffy Daniel Ricciardo, who doesn’t hold back with his thoughts on Max Verstappen’s opening lap: “It was what it was. I saw I had a good run out of one, I thought I’ll just go here and protect that place, and felt it hit. For sure it’s not on, that was amateur to say the least. I don’t think he likes when a team-mate gets in front of him. It was a very poor mistake. For sure, we’ll sort it out. I don’t think there’s an excuse for it. He got the line taken away from, he sees me go past, and it’s like ‘I’ve got to fix this’ and that’s it.”

8.26am EDT
08:26

Lap 14/70 Grosjean and Hulkenberg’s bump, a moment I haven’t seen much of, has been dismissed by the stewards as a racing incident. Yellow flags are out again briefly in sector one but are back in their holsters almost immediately. Vettel’s lead is already up to 3.4secs, but the biggest gap in the top six is between Raikkonen in second and Bottas in third of 5.6secs.

8.23am EDT
08:23

Lap 12/70 Clears signs of degradation on Lewis Hamilton’s rear tyres, but his priority at the moment is communication with Mercedes who are having some system issues in the garage – though soon enough they get in touch to say it’s fixed. “Good to have you back,” says Hamilton. 

8.21am EDT
08:21

Lap 11/70 After a helter-skelter start things have settled a little in the Hungarian sunshine. Vettel has established a lead of more than two seconds from Raikkonen, with Bottas, Verstappen, Hamilton and Sainz making up the top six. Updated

8.18am EDT
08:18

Lap 9/70 The stewards have come down on Max Verstappen over the incident with Ricciardo, dishing out a 10-second penalty. An opening lap bump between Grosjean and Hulkenberg is also being investigated.

8.16am EDT
08:16

Lap 7/70 Fantastic battling between Perez, Alonso and Sainz with the latter jumping past the former world champion and up to sixth, one place behind Hamilton. Back in the paddock, Ricciardo is watching a replay, his famous grin nowhere to be seen. 

8.14am EDT
08:14

Lap 6/70 That Verstappen lock up was unfortunate but Ricciardo will still be fuming that his team-mate took such an aggressive line. The safety car comes in, and Vettel zips away with Raikkonen on his tail. Hamilton attacks Verstappen and they’re wheel to wheel through the first few corners, but the teenager won’t yield!

8.11am EDT
08:11

Lap 4/70 The safety car is out and leading Vettel round the Hungaroring, followed by Raikkonen, Bottas, Verstappen, Hamilton, Sainz, Alonso, Perez, Vandoorne, and Ocon in 10th. 

8.09am EDT
08:09

Lap 2/70 Yellow flags as Ricciardo’s car is dealt with. The replay shows Hamilton try to hold the inside line on the tight turn one and get swamped by both Red Bulls, but on turn two Verstappen seems to lock up slightly, slamming into the side of his team-mate. A moment later Ricciardo is spinning across the track, and very fortunate not to take a big hit as he spun. Updated

Vettel cuts off Raikkonen into turn one and holds on to the lead. Behind them is the action as Hamilton gets a sluggish start and Verstappen overtakes him. On turn three Ricciardo spins, he’s out! “Someone hit me, Max I think it was,” says Ricciardo, of his Red Bull team-mate. Sainz is up to sixth, Perez all the way up to eighth. Updated

It’s a long run at Hungary down to the first corner, which should help negate a pile-up on the opening lap but also offers plenty of opportunity to overtake, something which becomes an awful lot harder once into the meat of the race. Getting off the grid well will be crucial.

After his dominance of Silverstone, Saturday was supposed to be the moment Lewis Hamilton equalled Michael Schumacher’s record of 68 poles, which had stood untouched for 11 years. Instead, those expecting Hamilton to drive off into the distance with the championship got a surprise – and a welcome one for fans of a title dust up.Ferrari were much too quick for Mercedes around the Hungaroring, where Sebastian Vettel qualified on pole for today’s race alongside his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen second. “The car was phenomenal and when I saw it was two reds up front I let out a big scream,” said Vettel after qualifying. “It’s only Saturday of course and the big challenge comes tomorrow, but after all the talk after the last race [that Ferrari were finished] it was good to give the answer on the track.” If Hamilton is to claim a sixth win at one of his favourite circuits, and overturn his one-point deficit at the top of the drivers’ championship, he will have to do it the hard way.The three-time world champion starts fourth behind his team-mate Valtteri Bottas in an all-Mercedes second row who help to make up a nicely symmetrical front eight; Max Verstappen leads Daniel Ricciardo in an all-Red Bull third row, and Fernando Alonso starts ahead of Stoffel Vandoorne for the resurgent McLaren who occupy the fourth row – their finest grid positions of the season. Formula One takes its summer break after Hungary, making this a pretty handy moment to land a telling blow. Vettel is in position to do just that.Lights out: 1pm BST, 2pm local time Updated

Judges in Portugal were guilty of sexual discrimination in a medical compensation case when they decided that the importance of sex diminished with the age of a woman, Europe’s human rights court has ruled.Maria Morais, a 50-year-old Portuguese woman with two children, claimed that medical negligence during botched gynaecological surgery at a Portuguese hospital in 1995 left her unable to have normal sex. She won her compensation case for physical and mental suffering, but the hospital then won a 2013 appeal that cut the payout by around one-third.Justifying the cut, judges in Lisbon argued sex was not as important because of her age. The three-judge panel — made up of two men and a woman — were all over 50, according to Morais’s lawyer, Vitor Ribeiro. The case triggered a storm of protest in Portugal, where one female lawmaker described the ruling as “Taliban jurisprudence.”The France-based European court of human rights sided with Morais, saying Portuguese judges were guilty of “prejudices” and had violated the right to respect for private and family life. It ordered Portugal to pay Morais €3,250 ($3,790) in damages and €2,460 for costs and expenses.The Portuguese court’s decision “ignored the physical and psychological importance of sexuality for women’s self-fulfillment and other dimensions of women’s sexuality”, the European court said.“The [Lisbon court] decision had moreover been based on the general assumption that sexuality was not as important for a 50-year-old woman and mother of two children as for someone of a younger age. In the [European] court’s view those considerations showed the prejudices prevailing in the judiciary in Portugal,” it added.There was no immediate reaction from Portuguese authorities.The European court noted two other judgments in Portugal, in 2008 and 2014, concerning medical malpractice complaints by two male patients. In those cases, Portugal’s supreme court found that the fact that the men could no longer have normal sexual relations had affected their self-esteem and brought “tremendous or strong mental shock”, regardless of their age or whether they had had children or not.• This article was amended on 26 July 2017.

Newcastle United owner and Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has won a high court battle over a £15m deal allegedly made in a London pub, calling time on a case that will be long remembered for days of evidence concerning excessive alcohol consumption.The case revolved around investment banker Jeffrey Blue’s allegation that during a “night of heavy drinking” at the Horse and Groom pub near Sports Direct’s Oxford Street store in January 2013, Ashley agreed to pay him £15m if the company’s shares doubled to £8.However, on Wednesday, Mr Justice Leggatt, who had said he found the case was “a lot more interesting than some”, ruled that no one would have thought what Ashley said in the pub was “serious”.“The Sports Direct senior management meetings certainly show that Mr Ashley is happy to combine discussion of business matters with the consumption of alcohol,” the judge said in his ruling. “But there is no evidence to suggest that Mr Ashley has ever negotiated or concluded a contract at one of these meetings.“The evening at the Horse and Groom was, in any event, a considerably less formal occasion than the senior management meetings, as there was no agenda or structure for the occasion and the conversation was largely social or general chat, rather than being specifically directed to any business subject.” Ashley was not in court to hear the judge deliver his ruling, but his lawyers said he had won a “comprehensive” victory.In a statement, the businessman said: “The only reason the Sports Direct share price exceeded £8, and will hopefully do so again, is because of the sterling efforts of all the people who work at Sports Direct.”Ashley, who gave evidence at the trial, said he could not recall making the alleged deal and if he had it would have been “obviously just banter”.He had told the court that he had met Blue, who was then an adviser to Sports Direct, and three other finance specialists at the Horse & Groom pub and “consumed a lot of alcohol”.“I can’t remember the details of the conversations that we had in the pub as it was a heavy night of drinking,” Ashley had said. “I do remember that we had a lot of drinks and a lot of banter. “If I did say to Mr Blue that I would pay him £15m if he could increase [Sports Direct’s] share price to £8, it would be obvious to everyone, including Mr Blue, that I wasn’t being serious.” He said he paid Blue, whom he called “Jeffers”, £1m for “other deals” unrelated to the night in the Horse & Groom.Sports Direct’s shares hit the £8 price target in February 2014. The shares have since collapsed below £3, in part because of reputational damage caused by a Guardian investigation that revealed workers at the retailer’s Derbyshire warehouse were being paid less than the minimum wage.Shortly after the shares hit £8 at 1.04pm on 25 February 2014 Blue’s wife, who was also in court, texted him to say: “It’s hit 8!!!!!”.Blue told the judge that Ashley was a “serious businessman”. He said the work ethic at Sports Direct was “like nothing else I have ever seen”, but he said Ashley sometimes did business “in unorthodox ways and in unusual venues”.Blue claimed Ashley once vomited into a fireplace after a senior management meeting that was “effectively a pub lock-in” and said the businessman would take naps under tables at “boring” meetings.Lawyers told the judge that Ashley had run up legal bills of £1.5m, and Blue bills of “£1m-odd”. The judge said Blue would have to pick up Ashley’s legal bills and £600,000 would have to be paid on account within the next month.Lawyers indicated that Blue had been “assisted” by insurers in launching the litigation.

Capita, one of the UK’s largest outsourcing companies, has demanded payouts of up to £21,000 from graduates who tried to pull out of an unpaid training scheme under which they were not guaranteed a job.The company, which provides services ranging from electronic tagging of offenders to store card services for retailers and BBC licence fee collection, has been criticised for advertising a number of roles in its IT resourcing division that stipulate applicants must be a graduate and able to attend between two and four months of unpaid training in London or Manchester.Former trainees who spoke to The Guardian said they had been disappointed with the scheme, as the training consisted almost exclusively of online reading from a digital library without any direct teaching or on-the-job experience.One former trainee described the course as “absolutely useless”. They said: “All you get is academic textbooks to read. Anyone expecting a hands-on approach would be disappointed. I was offered a few opportunities by other graduate schemes and companies [during the Capita training] but I refused them as I was under the threat of a liability to pay £21,000. I thought at the end of it how foolish I was.”Another former trainee said that they had decided to leave after just over a year of working for Capita and had been asked to pay about £21,000. After protesting, the trainee ended up without her last month of pay, or about £1,200.“I think they knew I was vulnerable as I started as a graduate,” the trainee said. The trainee sought a new job after finding they were being used to “fill HR gaps” rather than being given roles suitable to her training.Capita said that it now charged £13,000 to trainees who wanted to leave before completing their training and two years of work. It said it had previously charged different rates depending on the role involved.A spokesperson said: “All participants in the training are made fully aware, at numerous times prior to commencing the training, that it is provided free of charge to only those people who successfully complete the course and are engaged by Capita or a Capita client. Those who successfully complete the training but cannot be found a role within 90 days also receive the training free of charge.”Further revelations about the Capita scheme come as it emerges that one of Capita’s rivals, FDM Group, a FTSE-listed company which works with the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, also demands graduates sign up to months of unpaid training in order to secure jobs.The group’s graduate programme includes up to 14 weeks of unpaid training, after which it says 99% of attendees are placed in a job.The company also demands that trainees pay up to £20,000 if they leave during the training or the first two years of work.A spokeswoman for FDM said: “The professional training we provide is a major financial investment in our people and in line with employers who invest in their people, we have clauses in our contracts that look to recoup the cost of training with a cap of £20,000 if a person leaves during training or the first two years of consulting. We have a commitment to transparency with all applicants to ensure that they understand the terms clearly. Trainees have 14 days from when they start training to trial the programme and leave with no fees charged.”“We have a clear and unwavering commitment for all trainees and employees to be treated and compensated fairly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our employees receive a competitive graduate salary that far exceeds national minimum wage levels.“Individuals undertaking our bespoke training do not engage in any work or provide any services for us or any of our clients until they have successfully completed their training, passed all relevant internal and external examinations and been assessed as ready for the workplace.”"

Caeleb Dressel knows the comparisons are coming.After pulling off an unprecedented Triple Crown at swimming’s world championships, it’s time to take on the legacy of Michael Phelps.The 20-year-old Dressel established himself as America’s newest star of the pool Saturday, becoming the first swimmer to win three gold medals on a single night at either the worlds or the Olympics.Not even Phelps managed such an audacious feat.Dressel won the 50m freestyle and the 100m butterfly before leading off a world-record performance in the 4x100-meter mixed freestyle relay.“The comparisons are probably inevitable,” Dressel said. “But I’m not the same person as Michael.”Yet it was downright Phelps-like the way he pulled off a remarkable night of swimming at Duna Arena. Dressel raced three times over the course of about two hours – and won every time. Not to mention, he had to find time to warm down and get to three medal ceremonies.“I think I only had to run twice,” Dressel said with a smile.The University of Florida student – yep, he’s got an algebra exam coming up Monday that he’ll be taking online – has won six golds medals in Budapest.That gives him a shot at moving into more rarified territory: Phelps is the only swimmer to win seven golds at a world championships, which he did at Melbourne in 2007 as a prelude to his record eight golds the following year at the Beijing Olympics.Dressel will be a virtual lock to win his seventh when he competes on the 4x100 medley relay Sunday, the final event of the championships.Again, those comparisons to Phelps.“It’s a tough question,” Dressel said. “I don’t know if I welcome them. But I know they’re going to come. I don’t think it puts any pressure on me. I just want to keep doing my thing at this meet and for the future.”Phelps was certainly impressed and texted his congratulations shortly after the relay event. “This kid is on fire!!” Phelps wrote on Instagram, including a picture of him celebrating with Dressel during a gold medal-winning relay they were both on last summer at the Rio Olympics. “So damn fun to watch buddy!!!!”Dressel started the night with a furious dash from one end of the pool to the other, adding the 50 free world title to the 100 free he already had. He came back about a half-hour later to nearly break Phelps’ world record in the 100 fly, posting a time of 49.86 that was just four-hundredths off the mark set in 2009 at the rubber suit-aided championships in Rome.The final relay was merely a coronation, the Americans romping to gold in 3 minutes, 19.60 seconds – eclipsing by nearly 3 1/2 seconds the mark they set two years ago at worlds.“Man, that was a lot of fun,” Dressel said.He even managed to overshadow Katie Ledecky, who won her fifth gold medal of the meet by cruising to victory in the 800 free. Yet Budapest will be remembered as bit of a disappointment for the star of the 2016 Summer Games, who settled for silver in the 200 free and didn’t come close to breaking any of her personal bests.Ledecky won in 8:12.68, which was nearly eight seconds off her world record at Rio de Janeiro.“I’ve never walked away from a season completely satisfied, even last year,” she said. “I can really take what I’ve learned and use it moving forward. It gets me really excited. If that was my bad year for the next four years, then the next couple years are going to be pretty exciting.”Sweden’s Sarah Sjostrom was another standout, bouncing back from a disappointing loss the previous night to win gold in the 50 fly and set a world record in the semifinals of 50 free. Her time of 23.67 broke the mark of 23.73, set in 2009 by Britta Steffen.In the women’s 200 backstroke, Emily Seebohm of Australia shrugged off the roaring Hungarian crowd to take gold over home-country favorite Katinka Hosszu.Sjostrom set her second world record of the meet, having already established a new standard in the 100 free while swimming the leadoff leg of the 4x100 free relay.But even the Swedish star took note of Dressel’s performance.“I don’t even know if he went to the Olympics last year,” she said. “He took a really big step this year as we can see. It’s really impressive, really cool to see.”Indeed, Dressel has emerged as the breakout performer of these championships, with a bit of help from the relatively new mixed relays. Two of his golds came in events that feature men and women on the same team, races Phelps never competed in at worlds.“It’s crazy,” Dressel said. “But I had mixed relays helping me out, so it’s a bit different.”Yet no less impressive.Dressel led off the mixed free relay with a blistering time of 47.22 for the first 100 – even more remarkable given what he’d already been through – and his three teammates – Nathan Adrian, Mallory Comerford and Simone Manuel – took it from there.“That last relay was a lot of fun,” Dressel said. “I wanted to lead it off even though it meant less to get ready for it. It was such a blast.”The whole night was.“I haven’t had much time to think,” Dressel said, pondering the significance of it all. “As physically demanding as it is, mentally it’s even more straining. So I have 24 hours until my next swim. I’ll give myself 30 minutes tonight to, I guess, let it sink in a bit, then it’s time to refocus for that relay tomorrow.”"
41,"A new study has found the rule that patients must complete the course of their prescribed antibiotics is false instead they should stop taking the drugs when they feel better. The study disproves traditional practice of completing courses, which claims that taking too few tablets allows the disease-causing bacteria to mutate and become resistant to the drug.","Experts suggest patients should stop taking the drugs when they feel better rather than completing their prescription

Telling patients to stop taking antibiotics when they feel better may be preferable to instructing them to finish the course, according to a group of experts who argue that the rule long embedded in the minds of doctors and the public is wrong and should be overturned.Patients have traditionally been told that they must complete courses of antibiotics, the theory being that taking too few tablets will allow the bacteria causing their disease to mutate and become resistant to the drug.But Martin Llewelyn, a professor in infectious diseases at Brighton and Sussex medical school, and colleagues claim that this is not the case. In an analysis in the British Medical Journal, the experts say “the idea that stopping antibiotic treatment early encourages antibiotic resistance is not supported by evidence, while taking antibiotics for longer than necessary increases the risk of resistance”.There are some diseases where the bug can become resistant if the drugs are not taken for long enough. The most obvious example is tuberculosis, they say. But most of the bacteria that cause people to become ill are found on everybody’s hands in the community, causing no harm, such as E coli and Staphylococcus aureus. People fall ill only when the bug gets into the bloodstream or the gut. The longer such bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, the more likely it is that resistance will develop.The experts say there has been too little research into the ideal length of a course of antibiotics, which also varies from one individual to the next, depending in part on what antibiotics they have taken in the past.In hospital, patients can be tested to work out when to stop the drugs. “Outside hospital, where repeated testing may not be feasible, patients might be best advised to stop treatment when they feel better,” they say. That, they add, is in direct contravention of World Health Organisation advice.Other experts in infectious diseases backed the group. “I have always thought it to be illogical to say that stopping antibiotic treatment early promotes the emergence of drug-resistant organisms,” said Peter Openshaw, president of the British Society for Immunology. “This brief but authoritative review supports the idea that antibiotics may be used more sparingly, pointing out that the evidence for a long duration of therapy is, at best, tenuous. Far from being irresponsible, shortening the duration of a course of antibiotics might make antibiotic resistance less likely.”Alison Holmes, a professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College London, said a great British authority, Prof Harold Lambert, had made the same point in a Lancet article entitled “Don’t keep taking the tablets” as early as 1999. “It remains astonishing that apart from some specific infections and conditions, we still do not know more about the optimum duration of courses or indeed doses in many conditions, yet this dogma has been pervasive and persistent.”Jodi Lindsay, a professor of microbial pathogenesis at St George’s, University of London, said it was sensible advice. “The evidence for ‘completing the course’ is poor, and the length of the course of antibiotics has been estimated based on a fear of under-treating rather than any studies,” she said. “The evidence for shorter courses of antibiotics being equal to longer courses, in terms of cure or outcome, is generally good, although more studies would help and there are a few exceptions when longer courses are better – for example, TB.”But the Royal College of GPs expressed concerns. “Recommended courses of antibiotics are not random,” said its chair, Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard. “They are tailored to individual conditions and in many cases, courses are quite short – for urinary tract infections, for example, three days is often enough to cure the infection. “We are concerned about the concept of patients stopping taking their medication midway through a course once they ‘feel better’, because improvement in symptoms does not necessarily mean the infection has been completely eradicated. It’s important that patients have clear messages and the mantra to always take the full course of antibiotics is well known. Changing this will simply confuse people.”England’s chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, said: “The message to the public remains the same: people should always follow the advice of healthcare professionals. To update policies, we need further research to inform them.“[The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] is currently developing guidance for managing common infections, which will look at all available evidence on appropriate prescribing of antibiotics.“The Department of Health will continue to review the evidence on prescribing and drug-resistant infections, as we aim to continue the great progress we have made at home and abroad on this issue.”"

Donald Trump has forced out Reince Priebus as the White House chief of staff and replaced him with the homeland security secretary, Gen John Kelly.Trump tweeted: “I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House chief of staff. He is a great American … and a great leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my administration.”The departure of Priebus came as little surprise after he was the subject of a furious, foul-mouthed attack by new communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who claimed he would be asked to quit imminently. Priebus told the Wall Street Journal in a text message that he resigned privately on Thursday.Trump – who in six months has now lost a chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, national security adviser, communications director and press secretary – added on Twitter: “I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him!”According to a pooled report, Trump sent the tweets shortly after Air Force One landed back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, following a trip to Long Island, New York. Priebus and Scaramucci were also on the flight.In a statement, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said: “General John Kelly is one of the true stars of the administration. He has helped seal the border and reduced illegal immigration by 70%. He is respected by everyone, especially the people at the Department of Homeland Security.“The entire administration loves him and no one is comparable. He will begin on Monday morning and a cabinet meeting will follow his swearing in Monday morning.”She added: “The president thanks Reince Priebus for his service. They accomplished a lot together. He was loyal in his dedication to the president. The president thanks him and his family for his great service to the country, and he will always be a member of the Trump team.”Sanders then spoke to reporters outside her office. Asked if the decision was Priebus’s or Trump’s, she replied: “We all serve at the pleasure of the president. The conversations about this started with the president and Reince about two weeks ago, in terms of timing.”She denied that the change had anything do with Scaramucci, and said Trump and Kelly had been “talking about it for a while”.On Friday, Priebus said in a statement: “It has been one of the greatest honours of my life to serve this president and our country. I want to thank the president for giving me this very special opportunity. I will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the president’s agenda and policies. I can’t think of a better person than John Kelly to succeed me and I wish him God’s blessings and great success.”In an interview with CNN just two hours after his departure was announced, Priebus paid homage to Trump. “I am going to honor the president every day,” he said, adding: “I’m always going to be a Trump fan. I’m on Team Trump.” He refused to respond to Scaramucci’s comments, saying: “I’m not going to get into the mud.”While Priebus insisted he had resigned, there were strong hints that there was more under the surface. He said on CNN that the president had wanted to “hit the reset button” and “intuitively determined that it was time to do something differently”.On Friday, House speaker Paul Ryan, a close Priebus ally who has had a tense relationship with Trump, said: “Reince Priebus has left it all out on the field, for our party and our country. Here is a guy from Kenosha, Wisconsin, who revitalized the Republican national committee and became White House chief of staff. He has served the president and the American people capably and passionately. He has achieved so much, and he has done it all with class. I could not be more proud to call Reince a dear friend.”He added: “I congratulate Secretary Kelly on his appointment, and look forward to working with him to advance our agenda.”Priebus was one of the least powerful chiefs of staff in recent history, and his future had long been a matter of speculation. In a highly unorthodox move, Trump decided that Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon would serve as “equal partners” in implementing his agenda.The gossip intensified rapidly a week ago, when Scaramucci was appointed as communications director despite Priebus’s objections. The former Wall Street banker claimed they were “like brothers” but tensions soon flared.Scaramucci clearly suspected Priebus of leaking information to the media. This led him to call the New Yorker and give an interview in which he described Priebus as “a fucking paranoid schizophrenic” who would soon be asked to resign.On Tuesday, Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that no staff shakeup was in the cards. But according to media reports, he privately floated potential replacements including Kelly, deputy national security adviser Dina Powell, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and former campaign adviser David Urban.In an interview earlier this week, Michael Steele, predecessor of Priebus as chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), said: “It’s very clear the president has very little confidence in him. Reince’s head is on the block, as was Sean Spicer’s. Sean just got up and removed himself before the axe came down.”Priebus is the latest casualty in Trump’s West Wing. Others include national security adviser Michael Flynn, former deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, press secretary Sean Spicer and press aide Michael Short.Priebus went out of his way to appease Trump’s insurgent candidacy during the 2016 election campaign. After Trump’s victory in the Indiana primary and Ted Cruz’s decision to drop out, Priebus declared Trump the presumptive nominee, though Ohio governor John Kasich was still in the race, and then used the full muscle of the RNC to quash efforts to deny Trump the Republican nomination at the party convention in Cleveland.He also went in person to Trump Tower in 2015 for Trump to sign a loyalty oath to the Republican party, a deeply unusual step for an RNC chair to court such a recalcitrant candidate.Kelly, meanwhile, has been arguably Trump’s favourite cabinet secretary and is leading efforts to build a wall on the Mexican border. Kelly ran the US southern command, which includes the military prison at Guantánamo Bay. In 2010, his son, Lt Robert Michael Kelly, was killed after stepping on a landmine in Afghanistan.In a Memorial Day speech at Arlington national cemetery earlier this year, Trump said: “I especially want to extend our gratitude to Secretary John Kelly for joining us today. Incredible man. I always like to call him General. He understands more than most ever could or ever will the wounds and burdens of war.”Kelly said in a statement he was honoured to be asked to serve as chief of staff, adding praise for the staff of the homeland security department: “When I left the Marines, I never thought I would find as committed, as professional, as patriotic a group of individuals. I was wrong. You accomplish great things every day defending our nation and I know your exceptional work will continue.”Kelly’s appointment leaves a gap at the Department of Homeland Security. Claire McCaskill, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee, said: “General Kelly has a long history of service to our country and I had a good working relationship with him as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. With the threats facing this nation, I urge the president to nominate a qualified secretary to replace General Kelly as quickly as possible.”In a week of exceptional turmoil, Trump has also turned his ire on Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, accusing him of weakness for recusing himself from the investigation into the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with Russia."

The potential end of an era looms in British aviation after Sir Richard Branson announced he is selling 31% of Virgin Atlantic, relinquishing his controlling interest in the airline he founded in 1984.Branson will net £220m from the deal to sell the 31% stake to Air France-KLM and remain as chairman of the airline. He retains a 20% interest, leaving the US giant Delta as the largest shareholder in Virgin Atlantic with 49%.Virgin Atlantic is expected to retain its independence as a UK airline and will continue to fly under the Virgin brand.The deal forms part of an extensive tie-up on lucrative transatlantic routes announced by Virgin, Delta and Air France-KLM on Thursday. The three airlines, along with ailing Italian carrier Alitalia, will join together in a single joint venture on flights between Europe and the US, co-operating on schedules and frequent flyer schemes – an alliance that will step up competition with the partnership between American Airlines and Branson’s great rival, British Airways.Branson said it was “a fantastic opportunity to extend our network and create a stronger customer champion, as well as being extremely beneficial to our people and the Virgin Atlantic brand”. The 67-year-old entrepreneur, probably the most famous face in the modern aviation industry, started out by chartering and selling seats on his first plane when a flight was cancelled in the Caribbean. He later positioned his Virgin Atlantic airline as an exciting, glamorous upstart trying to break the grip of a stuffy BA on UK aviation. That rivalry intensified in the “dirty tricks” battle in the 1980s, which saw Branson win a large libel settlement from BA. He later presented the airline’s first tie-up with Delta, announced in 2012, as a response to the national carrier’s dominance from Heathrow to the US. Delta bought a 49% stake in Virgin in 2013 – a move that BA’s chief executive, Willie Walsh, predicted would end in Branson ceding control within five years.Virgin Atlantic edged into profit from 2014 to 2016, but had forecast losses this year on the back of the Brexit referendum and the fall in sterling.In a letter to staff on Thursday, Branson said it was an exciting day for the airline, and said he would still remain as the largest individual shareholder, adding that his new partners all agreed the brand should survive. But he noted that the airline had been operating for half his lifetime, and added: “As I get a little older, I want to be certain that all the necessary building blocks are in place for Virgin Atlantic to continue to prosper and grow for the next 50 years. “The airline industry has consolidated over Virgin Atlantic’s lifetime and it’s now our turn to put ourselves at the heart of an important alliance ... With these three partners in place and with me – and one day, the wider Branson family – still very much involved, we have the foundations to make sure this is so.”Atlanta-based Delta already had a joint venture with Air France-KLM dating back to 2009, including Alitalia from 2010.Delta also announced on Thursday it would buy a 10% stake in Air France-KLM for €375m (£335m), as will China Eastern, with both joining the European airline conglomerate’s board, subject to regulatory approval.

An anonymous blogpost accusing a Silicon Valley venture capitalist of sexual misconduct was written by a male executive who pretended to be a female victim of harassment in order to damage the reputation of a competitor, according to a lawsuit.The complaint filed by Anis Uzzaman, a prominent tech investor and CEO of Fenox Venture Capital, alleged that a male rival CEO published a fake online account purporting to be an unnamed woman who was “sexually taken advantage of” by Uzzaman. The blogpost, which said Uzzaman pressured the author to go to his hotel room after a business meeting, was written by Brandon Katayama Hill, founder and CEO of a San Francisco branding and marketing agency called Btrax that competes with Fenox, according to the suit. Uzzaman’s attorneys said the blogpost was traced to the IP address of Hill’s home. Reached for comment on Thursday, Hill denied that he was the author of the post, claiming that other people had access to his wifi and that he did not know who wrote it. The lawsuit comes at a time when women across Silicon Valley have come forward with allegations of sexual harassment following a viral account of misconduct and discrimination at Uber. Over the past month, there has been increasing scrutiny of venture capitalists following a series of stories alleging that powerful male investors have repeatedly harassed women seeking startup funding, who are particularly vulnerable and have few recourses to raise concerns when they are mistreated or assaulted by VCs.Uzzaman’s lawyers have alleged that Hill took advantage of the discussion about discrimination in the industry to target a rival. “To have these false accusations come particularly in this climate when there’s this growing awareness of a problem that does exist, it’s damaging,” Katrina Saleen, Uzzaman’s attorney, told the Guardian. “It’s also an insult to true victims of sexual harassment … It makes people question the veracity of true victims, which is harmful.” According to the complaint, the blogpost, titled “I was sexually taken advantage of by a Silicon Valley VC”, was published in March on a popular Japanese blog site, Hatena. The post said the author met the “very famous” VC at a local startup event and that he asked her to meet and talk about business. The VC invited the woman to go on a trip with her and stay at a five-star hotel, and when she refused, he said: “You are going to lose the biggest opportunity if you do not come,” according to the post. The VC said he might invest in her and pressured her to go to his hotel that night, but she refused, the post said. Later, he stopped communicating with her, saying: “I’m busy, don’t contact me.” “A lot of people from Japan, including students, and many very cute girls come to him, and he takes advantage of them,” said the blogpost, which was written in Japanese and translated to English in the complaint. The blog did not name Uzzaman but he was easily identifiable, according to the complaint. There are only a few Silicon Valley companies that do venture capital services for Japan, and Fenox is the only firm which has a non-Japanese leader with “dark skin” who is fluent in Japanese, as the blog outlined, the suit said. The comments section referenced Fenox and Uzzaman, according to the complaint. A Japanese court eventually ordered Hatena to produce the IP address traced to the article, and attorneys confirmed through Comcast that the post, published on a Saturday morning, was linked to the home address of Hill, the suit said. Hill’s company has offices in California and Japan and operates in the “same general domain” as Uzzaman’s firm, working with startups funded by Japanese corporations, the complaint said.Hill also used to run a San Francisco startup competition called Japan Night, and Fenox Venture Capital last year launched a similar event called Startup World Cup. The blogpost was published weeks before the event.“This event is very important to them. For this to have come out just before … is damaging,” said Saleen.In a short phone interview, Hill said he had not yet seen the complaint, which was filed last week in San Mateo superior court, adding: “I didn’t write the article. I’m not responsible for it. This is a false allegation.” Hill further claimed that more than 50 people had access to his wifi, though he declined to identify them. He also declined to comment on whether he had suspicions on who may have authored the blogpost. He further claimed that his firm did not compete with Fenox: “We are in totally different businesses.”Asked about Hill’s denial, Saleen said: “Comcast has confirmed that the IP address that the blog was posted from is from Brandon Hill’s home … We’ve also confirmed that he has password-protected wifi.” Through his attorney, Uzzaman declined to comment.

Baltimore Ravens offensive lineman John Urschel has abruptly retired from the NFL after just three seasons, the team announced on Thursday.The 26-year-old from Winnipeg, who is a doctoral candidate in applied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was expected to compete for a starting role at center or guard in training camp, which gets under way this week in suburban Baltimore.Urschel’s surprise decision comes two days after the release of a medical study that further underscored the link between the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and participation in football. Researchers at Boston University and the Boston Veterans Affairs health system examined 111 deceased NFL players’ brains that were donated to scientific research and found CTE in 110 of them, or 99% of those studied.The Baltimore Sun and ESPN said that Urschel’s decision was linked to the results of the study, citing anonymous sources close to the team.Urschel’s agent, when reached by the Guardian on Thursday, said the player has no statement or comment and will not be doing media at this time.“This morning, John Urschel informed me of his decision to retire from football,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said in a statement Thursday. “We respect John and respect his decision. We appreciate his efforts over the past three years and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.”Urschel has been pursuing his doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the offseason with a concentration on spectral graph theory, numerical linear algebra and machine learning. He earned his bachelor’s and master’s in mathematics at Penn State, where he played on the football team and was chosen by the Ravens in the fifth round of the 2014 NFL draft.A January profile of Urschel for HBO’s newsmagazine Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel found the lineman at odds with reconciling his two gifts. He further elaborated on the dilemma in a first-person essay for the Players’ Tribune in 2015.“I recognize that this is somewhat irrational, but I am doing it,” Urschel told HBO’s Bernard Goldberg. “It’s more important to me that I’m able to do the two things I love. I don’t know if people have really done things that I’ve done before. I don’t know if they’ll do it after me. But I enjoy carving out my own path and not listening to what people say I can and I can’t do.”By retiring after three full seasons, Urschel is eligible for an NFL pension.Urschel is not the first player to attribute early retirement to fears over the connection between football and CTE. In March 2015, San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland retired after one season, a promising rookie campaign that saw him lead the team in tackles, due to concerns over the long-term effects of head trauma."
54,"A Russian man suspected of laundering at least $4 billion in digital currency Bitcoin has been arrested in Greece on Wednesday. The accused, Alexander Vinnik was described as the operator of BTC-e, an exchange used to trade Bitcoin since 2011, by US officials. Vinnik reportedly laundered the money for people involved in crimes like computer hacking and drug trafficking.","Russian operator of long-standing bitcoin exchange BTC-e indicted for laundering money including high-profile hack of funds from Mt Gox exchangeThe Russian “internationally sought ‘mastermind’ of a crime organisation” accused of laundering more than $4bn in bitcoin, including funds obtained from the hack of failed bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, has been arrested in Greece.A US jury indicted Alexander Vinnik on Wednesday after his arrest in a small beachside village in northern Greece on Tuesday, following an investigation led by the US justice department along with several other federal agencies and task forces.Vinnik was described by the justice department as the operator of BTC-e, an exchange used to trade the digital currency bitcoin since 2011, which was allegedly used to launder more than $4bn for people involved in crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking.US authorities also linked him to the failure of Mt Gox, the Japan-based bitcoin exchange that collapsed in 2014 after being hacked. Vinnik “obtained” funds from the hack of Mt Gox and laundered them through BTC-e and Tradehill, another San Francisco-based exchange he owned, they said in the statement.“Just as new computer technologies continue to change the way we engage each other and experience the world, so too will criminals subvert these new technologies to serve their own nefarious purposes,” said Brian Stretch, US attorney for the Northern District of California.Vinnik’s arrest is the latest in a series of US operations against Russian cybercriminals in Europe, including the taking down of two of the biggest dark web marketplaces for drugs, guns and other illicit items, AlphaBay and Hansa, last week.The prosecutions also coincide with intensified scrutiny of Russian hackers after US intelligence officials determined that Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential election using cyber-warfare methods to help Donald Trump, something Moscow denies.During his time in the digital currency market, US authorities allege Vinnik facilitated crimes including hacking, fraud, identity theft, tax refund fraud, public corruption and drug trafficking. Greek police described Vinnik as a “an internationally sought ‘mastermind’ of a crime organisation”. BTC-e, which has been out of service for more than a day, attributed this to “unplanned maintenance”. In a tweet on Wednesday after the arrest of Vinnik, BTC-e said it would restore service in the next five to 10 days.The exchange is one of the oldest virtual currency platforms. It allows users to trade bitcoin pseudonymously against a variety of fiat and virtual currencies, and is known in cryptocurrency markets as having relaxed standards for checking users’ identity, and for not collaborating with law enforcement."
55,A research conducted on the donated brains of 111 NFL players has found that 99% of them showed symptoms of a degenerative brain disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The study also found that the disease was increasingly severe in players who had spent more time on the field.,"Research involving brains of former NFL players find 99% suffered from disease with symptoms that include memory loss and mood disordersThe largest ever study of cases of football players with the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has, again, found a link between the condition and “prior participation in football”, particularly in professionals.The study looked at the brains of 111 NFL players and found CTE in 110 of them, or 99% of those studied. Researchers at Boston University and the Boston Veterans Affairs health system examined the brains of 202 high school, college, semi-professional and NFL players for evidence of the disease. They found increasingly severe CTE in players who had spent more time on the field. “My hope is we’ll stop arguing about whether or not this is a problem, or whether or not it needs to be addressed,” said Dr Ann McKee of Boston University. “We need to take our heads out of the sand. It’s not going away because we want it to.” CTE is associated with repeated blows to the head, including concussions. Symptoms include difficulty with attention and memory, dementia, mood disorders and headaches. The players in the study had played football for an average of 15 years, and died at a median age of 66 years old. CTE can only be definitively diagnosed after death.Researchers found the most severe cases of CTE in athletes who had played the longest, and at the highest levels. For example, the three high school football players identified with CTE had mild symptoms, but the majority of college and semi-professional players (56%) had severe signs of the disease. Eighty-six percent of professional players had severe CTE. Players with the most severe CTE were also most likely to report clinical symptoms. Of the 84 participants with severe CTE, 80 (95%) had cognitive symptoms, 75 (89%) had behavioral, mood symptoms or both, and 71 (85%) had signs of dementia. Researchers warned that their study can not be used to assess how many people who play football develop CTE, because their sample was not random. The brains were donated by family members, most of whom said their loved ones had reported CTE symptoms during their lifetimes. The former Chicago Bears running back Mike Adamle said he and others have formed a “fraternity” of players who have suspected cases of the disease. “The only thing I remember is he said, ‘You have symptoms that are concurrent with CTE,’” said Adamle, about a clinical diagnosis from his doctor. “We’ve got sort of a fraternity of players who just call each other up whenever we need it and for lack of a better phrase talk each other off the ledge … You really do get paranoid and depressed.”CTE was at first believed to primarily impact boxers, but in recent years it has increasingly become associated with football, hockey and military service. The NFL has for years been under sustained scrutiny because of the head trauma players endure. The NFL maintains that player safety is a top priority. However, as recently as 2016, a congressional investigation accused the NFL of seeking to influence CTE research with donations to the National Institutes of Medicine. The NFL only acknowledged a link between degenerative brain disorders and the sport in 2016, after years of downplaying the links. The league also recently settled a class action lawsuit with players for $1bn. “This is just the individuals who have come into our bank,” said McKee, noting it is unclear how many more players may have the disease. She said the need to be able to diagnose the disease while people are still alive is increasingly urgent. “We need to bring them reasons for hope and optimism,” she said. In a statement to the Guardian, the NFL said it welcomed McKee’s research. “We appreciate the work done by Dr McKee and her colleagues for the value it adds in the ongoing quest for a better understanding of CTE. Case studies such as those compiled in this updated paper are important to further advancing the science and progress related to head trauma. The medical and scientific communities will benefit from this publication and the NFL will continue to work with a wide range of experts to improve the health of current and former NFL athletes. “As noted by the authors, there are still many unanswered questions relating to the cause, incidence and prevalence of long-term effects of head trauma such as CTE. The NFL is committed to supporting scientific research into CTE and advancing progress in the prevention and treatment of head injuries.”"

Queensland will have a 2,000km network of electric vehicle charging stations that make up one of the world’s longest electric vehicle highways within six months.The state government announced on Thursday it would build an 18-station network stretching along Queensland’s east coast from Cairns to Coolangatta and west to Toowoomba.The stations, which recharge a vehicle in 30 minutes, will offer free power for at least a year in what the environment minister, Steven Miles, said was a bid to boost the number of electric cars on Queensland roads, currently about 700.“This project is ambitious, but we want as many people as possible on board the electric vehicle revolution, as part of our transition to a low-emissions future,” Miles said.The $3m network had “the potential to revolutionise the way we travel around Queensland in the future”, he said.Queensland’s “electric highway” will span a comparable distance to the “west coast electric highway” in the US, which runs from California to Oregon and Washington state. However it is dwarfed by the Trans-Canada EV highway, which, at about 8,000km, is the world’s longest.But the US in total now boasts 16,107 stations and 43,828 charging outlets, according to the US Department of Energy. Tesla drivers can reputedly make journeys of 20,000 km.The Queensland stations, which will range from the capital Brisbane to the small sugar town of Tully, would be powered with “green energy” bought through renewable energy credits or offsets.Miles said a state household energy survey showed half of Queenslanders would consider “an electric vehicle, plug-in hybrid or regenerative braking hybrid” when buying a new car in the next two years.While lower prices and longer-lasting batteries were driving global uptake, most in the survey said “improvements to public fast-charging infrastructure would further tempt them into purchasing an EV”, Miles said.Car executives from Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Mercedes Benz and Mitsubishi lined up to praise the move and called on other states to follow.The Audi Australia managing director, Paul Sansom, said electric car drivers travelling “the vast distances in between our capital cities … need to have confidence that they will be able to find a charging station when they need it, even if they’re driving in an unfamiliar region”.“This is the current expectation around frequency of petrol stations, and it’s, rightly, what consumers will demand as EVs become more prevalent.”Behyad Jafari, the chief executive of the Electric Vehicle Council, said the state government had shown “national leadership” with “a signal to the market that Queensland is serious about electric vehicles”.This gave the industry “certainty to unlock investment to grow our economy and create new, high skilled jobs”, he said.“I encourage all governments across Australia to follow suit, particularly as this support will help to provide motorists with increased choice of cars that are cheaper and healthier to operate.”Queensland is Australia’s biggest carbon polluter, with the transport sector making up the state’s second largest source of carbon emissions with 21.1m tonnes in 2014, having almost doubled since 1990.Passenger cars make up almost half of transport emissions, according to the state environment department.The $3m contract to build the network has been awarded to Brisbane technology company Tritium, which began as a solar car racing parts manufacturer."

Fifty years after homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales, 72 other countries and territories worldwide continue to criminalise same-sex relationships, including 45 in which sexual relationships between women are outlawed.There are eight countries in which homosexuality can result in a death penalty, and dozens more in which homosexual acts can result in a prison sentence, according to an annual report by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA).Southern and east Africa, the Middle East and south Asia persist with the most draconian approaches. Western Europe and the western hemisphere are the most tolerant.But Britain was by no means a frontrunner when it moved 50 years ago to partly decriminalise homosexuality. Some 20 other countries had already led the way, including France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Brazil and Argentina, all of whom had legalised it well before 1900.In Iran, Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, homosexuality is still punishable by death, under sharia law. The same applies in parts of Somalia and northern Nigeria. In two other countries – Syria and Iraq – the death penalty is carried out by non-state actors, including Islamic State.The report notes that, although the potential exists for a death penalty to be handed down under sharia courts in at least five other countries – Pakistan, Afghanistan, the UAE, Qatar and Mauritania – there is no evidence suggesting that it has been implemented for consensual same-sex acts between adults in private.Same-sex relations – which are variously criminalised under laws covering sodomy, buggery and “acts against nature” among others – could lead to a prison sentence in 71 states in all.However, this number excludes Egypt, where same-sex relations are technically legal but are vigorously pursued and where hundreds of people are reported to be detained on morality grounds.Altogether, more than 120 countries have decriminalised homosexuality. But some still cannot be described as liberal. Russia, for example, has recently introduced laws banning the promotion of homosexuality. Russia was recently rebuked by the European court of human rights for a 2013 law banning the spread of “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations” among minors.A co-author of the ILGA report, Aengus Carroll, said it remained the case that there was “no country in the world where LGBT people are safe from discrimination, stigmatisation or violence”.“Legislative change is slow enough in coming, but societal attitudes, particularly those that may evoke taboo, are painstakingly slow,” he said. However, he pointed to some positive developments, in countries including Botswana, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Tunisia, where advocates have recently won court cases affirming the right to form organisations to lobby for rights.There have also been “amazing strides” on sexual orientation and gender identity issues around the world.A parliamentary vote in Germany will lead to the legalisation of same-sex marriage later this year; marriage equality in Malta will bring to 24 the number of states allowing gay marriage. A similar number of states offer civil partnership recognition.At the time of publication of the ILGA report, there were 26 countries that allowed for joint adoption for same-sex couples and 27 in which same-sex second parent adoption – where a same-sex parent can legally become a step-parent to his or her partner’s child – was in place.A spokesman for the LGBT charity Stonewall said that, while it was important to remember how far the UK had come on LGBT rights since the 1967 Sexual Offences Act, many challenges remained.“Same-sex relations are illegal in 72 countries, and punishable by death in eight. We all have a part to play in ensuring all LGBT people are accepted without exception and all we can hope is that, in 50 more years, we will have lots more progress to look back on,” said Matt Horwood. “Trans people still face a number of legal barriers and LGBT people as a whole continue to face discrimination in their daily lives. LGBT people can find themselves excluded, or face verbal and physical abuse, whether at work, at school, in sport, in faith or within local communities.”"

A teenage girl is alleged to have married an Islamic State fighter in Syria via Skype and became so indoctrinated that she tried to get a gun and grenade to stage a terrorist attack against Britain. The girl, who cannot be named because of her age, appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday charged with the alleged plot.She is believed to be from a Moroccan background and was aged 16 when she met the alleged Isis terrorist, who originally comes from Coventry, online. He is now believed to be dead, killed in a drone strike in April.The teenager, from London, is accused of receiving instructions on how to use the weapons and asking for help in carrying out the plot. The case is said to have involved explicit foreign direction, and the plotting is alleged to have happened between 1 December 2016 and 12 April 2017.The accused was aged just 16 when she “married” the Isis fighter via Skype, in an online ceremony. There is considerable doubt that it would be considered valid under either Islamic or British laws. The man is understood to have used the internet and social media including Skype, an online voice and video communications programme.During Wednesday’s short court hearing, her lawyer, Vajahat Sharif, said that the girl would plead not guilty. In court, the teenager, wearing a Nike tracksuit and with her long black hair tied in a ponytail, spoke only to confirm her name and age.Deputy senior district judge Tan Ikram remanded her in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on 11 August. She will also appear there on the same date in relation to another terror offence for which she had previously been charged.In a statement the Metropolitan police said the teenager had been charged with having “the intention of committing acts of terrorism engaged in conduct in preparation for giving effect the that intention”.The elements of the offence, the Met said, were: “i. Communicating with a Daesh [Isis] fighter in Syria and arranging to receive weapons in order to conduct an attack in the UK; ii. Receiving instructions on how train and use weapons; iii. Reaching out to another to receive assistance in completing plan.”Last week, Met commissioner Cressida Dick said: “Six attack planning plots were thwarted in the last four months alone, and we can expect that figure to rise.”Britain’s top police officer added: “The bulk of this domestic threat seems to be from those who are inspired by overseas networks, though there have undoubtedly been some who have been more directly enabled by them also, and we should not assume that attempts by senior leaderships of overseas groups to direct more or less sophisticated UK attacks have gone away.”The terrorist threat level from Islamist inspired terrorism in Britain remains at severe, meaning that an attack is considered highly likely. Three such attacks have claimed lives in Britain since 22 March.• This article was amended on 23 August 2017 to correct the job title of judge Tan Ikram, who is a deputy senior district judge."

Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro’s attempt to use Latin hit Despacito - which means “slowly” – to inject some cool into his controversial new congress has backfired quickly. Maduro’s unpopular leftist government on Sunday promoted a remixed version of Despacito to encourage Venezuelans to vote for the Constituent Assembly, which will have powers to rewrite the national charter and supersede other institutions. “Our call to the Constituent Assembly only seeks to unite the country ... Despacito!” goes the Socialist Party-sanctioned remix of the catchy dance song, which was played during Maduro’s weekly televised show. “What do you think, eh? Is this video approved?” a grinning and clapping Maduro called out to the crowd, which roared back in approval. But Puerto Rican singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee on Monday said they do not approve at all.“At no point was I asked, nor did I authorize, the use or the change in lyrics of Despacito for political ambitions, and much less in the middle of a deplorable situation that Venezuela, a country I love so much, is living,” Fonsi said in a message posted on Twitter. Daddy Yankee, meanwhile, posted a picture of Maduro with a big red cross over it on Instagram. “That you illegally appropriate a song (Despacito) does not compare with the crimes you commit and have committed in Venezuela. Your dictatorial regime is a joke, not only for my Venezuelan brothers, but for the entire world,” he said. “With this nefarious marketing plan, you only highlight your fascist ideal.” Millions of Venezuelans have been staging months of protests against Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader narrowly elected to replace the late Hugo Chavez in 2013. Some 100 people have died in the unrest, which has further hammered an imploding economy that is running short of food and medicine. Critics say Maduro is trying to cement a dictatorship by pushing forward with the Constituent Assembly this Sunday. He says it is the only way to bring peace back to the convulsed nation."

On Monday evening, Donald Trump gave a speech to the 19th National Boy Scout Jamboree in West Virginia. Although he came armed with a prepared speech about the merits of scouting – each US president serves as the group’s honorary president – and declared at the start that he would not talk about politics, Trump went predictably off-script to talk about some favourite topics. And politics.Boy, you have a lot of people. The press will say it’s about 200 people. It looks like about 45,000 people.Tonight we put aside all of the policy fights in Washington DC that you have been hearing about with the fake news and all of that … Who the hell wants to talk about politics when I’m in front of the Boy Scouts?Today I said we oughta change it from the word swamp to the word cesspool or perhaps to the word sewer, but it’s not good.The scouts believe in putting America first.The vice-president of the United States, Mike Pence – good guy – was a scout and it meant so much to him. Some of you here tonight might even have camped out in this yard when Mike was the governor of Indiana, but the scouting was very, very important. And by the way, where are our Indiana scouts tonight? I wonder if the television cameras will follow you; they don’t like doing that when they see these massive crowds. They don’t like doing that. Hi folks. A lot of love in this big, beautiful place. A lot of love and a lot of love for our country. There’s a lot of love for our country.By the way, what do you think the chances are that this incredible, massive crowd, record-setting, is going to be shown on television tonight? One per cent or zero? The fake media will say: President Trump – and you know what this is – President Trump spoke before a small crowd of Boy Scouts today. That’s some – that is some crowd. Fake media. Fake news. Thank you.Secretary Tom Price is also here … And hopefully he’s going to get the votes tomorrow to start our path toward killing this thing known as Obamacare that’s really hurting us, folks.By the way, are you going to get the votes? He better get them. He better get them. Oh, he better – otherwise I’ll say, Tom, you’re fired. I’ll get somebody. He better get Senator Capito [Republican West Virginia senator Shelley Moore Capito] to vote for it. You got to get the other senators to vote for it. It’s time. After seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare, we have a chance to now do it. They better do it.By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a jamboree? And we’ll be back. We’ll be back. The answer is no, but we’ll be back.I have to tell you our economy is doing great. Our stock market has picked up since the election November 8. Do we remember that date? Was that a beautiful date? What a date. Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8, where they said – these dishonest people – where they said there is no path to victory for Donald Trump? … But do you remember that incredible night with the maps and the Republicans are red and the Democrats are blue, and that map was so red, it was unbelievable and they didn’t know what to say? And you know we have a tremendous disadvantage in the electoral college – popular vote is much easier.So I have to tell you, what we did, in all fairness, is an unbelievable tribute to you and all of the other millions and millions of people that came out and voted for Make America Great Again.And by the way, under the Trump administration, you’ll be saying Merry Christmas again when you go shopping. Believe me. Merry Christmas. They’ve been downplaying that little beautiful phrase. You’re going to be saying Merry Christmas again, folks.I’ll tell you a story that’s very interesting for me when I was young. There was a man named William Levitt, Levitttowns, you have some here, you have some in different states … And he was a very successful man. He was a homebuilder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful …And he sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. At the time especially, this was a long time ago, sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. And he went out and bought a big yacht and he had a very interesting life. I won’t go any more than that because you’re Boy Scouts, I’m not going to tell you what he did – should I tell you? Should I tell you? Oh, you’re Boy Scouts, but you know life, you know life. So, look at you, who would think this is the Boy Scouts, right?So he had a very interesting life, and the company that bought his company was a big conglomerate. And they didn’t know anything about building homes, and they didn’t know anything about picking up the nails and the sawdust and selling it, and the scraps of wood … So they called William Levitt up and they said, would you like to buy back your company and he said yes, I would. He so badly wanted it, he got bored with this life of yachts and sailing and all of the things he did in the south of France and other places … But what happened is he bought back his company and he bought back a lot of empty land … and in the end he failed and he failed badly. Lost all of his money. He went personally bankrupt, and he was now much older.And I saw him at a cocktail party and it was very sad. Because the hottest people in New York were at this party. It was the party of Steve Ross. Steve Ross, he was one of the great people. He came up and discovered – really founded – Time Warner, and he was a great guy. He had a lot of successful people at the party. And I was doing well so I got invited to the party.[This is a much abbreviated version: you can read the full Levitt reminiscence here and here.]"
68,"Israel has removed metal detectors from the entrance of Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque following days of violent protests over the installation. The move is aimed at ending the crisis which claimed seven lives, Israeli officials said. The Palestinians reportedly see the installation of metal detectors as an Israeli attempt to assert control over the holy site.","Move to dismantle security barriers near al-Aqsa mosque comes after days of violent confrontations that have claimed seven livesIsrael is removing metal detectors from entrances to the compound that houses al-Aqsa mosque.The move was announced late on Monday night by the office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and is designed to end a crisis over the holy site. Days of violent confrontations have claimed seven lives.Despite the Israeli announcement, however, a senior Muslim cleric in Jerusalem said worshippers should stay away from the shrine pending a review of the new Israeli security arrangements there.Ikrema Sabri, the head of the Supreme Islamic Committee in the city, said such a review may be completed later on Tuesday. Sabri said: “Our position is that for now, nobody should enter” the shrine.The removal of the detectors on Tuesday appeared to be part of a deal under which Israeli diplomats were repatriated from Jordan, including an embassy security guard who was involved in a fatal shooting of two Jordanians on Sunday night.The brief statement said the Israeli security cabinet, which met on Monday evening, had “accepted the recommendation of all of the security bodies to incorporate security measures based on advanced technologies (‘smart checks’) and other measures instead of metal detectors in order to ensure the security of visitors and worshippers in the Old City and on the Temple Mount”.The statement added that under the plan Israeli police would “reinforce” their presence around the holy site. It did not say when the metal detectors would be removed or what would replace them. Israeli media earlier reported that high-resolution cameras capable of detecting hidden objects would be the alternative.Earlier on Monday the UN’s Middle East envoy warned of the dangers of allowing the crisis to continue. “It is extremely important that a solution to the current crisis be found by Friday this week,” Nickolay Mladenov said after briefing the UN security council. “The dangers on the ground will escalate if we go through another cycle of Friday prayer without a resolution.” He said events in east Jerusalem were not “localised” but “affect millions if not billions of people around the world”.Even before the Israeli decision to remove the devices, it was unclear whether such a move would be sufficient to end the violence. Muslim religious officials – who allege Israel is trying to expand its control at the site – said they would accept only a return to the arrangements for access to the compound that had been in place before an incident on 14 Julywhen two Israeli policemen were shot by three Israeli Arab gunmen who had smuggled weapons on to the site.“This movement is a movement of the street,” said Sheikh Raed Dana of the waqf, the Islamic endowments organisation that administers the mosque compound, commenting on whether he believed worshippers should end protests and return to the shrine. “We as the waqf listen to the street. The street says yes and we say yes; if the street says no to the measures, we will say no.”There has been increasing criticism of the way the metal detectors were installed, without consultation with the waqf and reportedly over the objections of senior Israeli security officials who had warned of the risk of bloodshed.On Monday night Israeli diplomats were evacuated from the embassy in the Jordanian capital, Amman, after Sunday’s shooting of two Jordanians by a security guard.The diplomats, including Israel’s ambassador to Jordan, Einat Schlain, crossed the Allenby bridge border in a convoy, arriving back in Israel at around 11pm. Among those repatriated were the security guard whom Jordan had originally said it wanted to retain for questioning over the incident.A Jordanian news site linked to the kingdom’s military said investigators had determined that the altercation at the embassy compound was not politically motivated and that one of the Jordanians, a 17-year-old, had attacked the guard with a screwdriver in a dispute about a furniture delivery.Under an agreement negotiated by the head of Israel’s domestic security service, who had been sent to Amman to negotiate, Israel agreed that Jordanian police could hear the guard’s description of the incident in the presence of Israeli diplomats.Netanyahu’s office said the return of the diplomats had been made possible “thanks to close cooperation which was held in the past day between Israel and Jordan”."

He studied agriculture in rural England and was tipped by some as China’s future leader.But on Tuesday morning Sun Zhengcai’s political obituary was splashed across the front page of the Communist party’s official mouthpiece in a damning editorial entitled: “Rule strictly over the party with iron discipline.”“The investigation into comrade Sun Zhengcai sounds the alarm bell for the party,” the People’s Daily article warned, as it announced that the youngest member of China’s political elite had been ejected from power for a “serious violation of discipline”.“Top cadres must hold firm political positions, temper their political characters … and act in a manner consistent with the party’s central committee with [president] Xi Jinping as its core,” the broadsheet declared. Just a few weeks ago, Sun, a 53-year-old former agriculture minister who studied farming at Hertfordshire’s Rothamstad research centre in the 1990s, was the high-flying party chief of one of the world’s fastest-growing cities, the sweltering Yangtze port of Chongqing.Many believed he was being groomed for greatness and would use that job – handed to him in late 2012 after the sensational downfall of flamboyant party leader Bo Xilai – as a springboard from which to leap into one of seven highly-coveted spots on China’s top ruling body, the politburo standing committee. Places on that elite council will be up for grabs later this year when Chinese leaders flock to Beijing for their quinquennial enclave, the 19th Communist party congress.Such a promotion would likely have put Sun – part of the so-called sixth generation of post-revolution leaders – in line to succeed either Xi or premier Li Keqiang at the next party congress in 2022.But Xi’s unforeseen decision to purge Sun has shredded not only those expectations but also the playbook governing how one-party China conducts political leadership successions. In doing so, some experts fear Xi may also have set in motion a new phase of political turbulence in the world’s number two economy.“A smooth leadership transition is really crucial to the survival of Chinese Communist party rule in China and this really throws a monkey wrench into the machine,” said Susan Shirk, a US expert in elite Chinese politics who was deputy assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton.Shirk said that for almost two decades China’s rulers had abided by an unofficial succession system designed to prevent both cut-throat and destabilising internecine power struggles and the rise of strongman dictators who could cling to power until they died or were violently overthrown.According to those unwritten rules, presumptive heirs to the Communist party’s top two jobs, general secretary and premier, should be informally anointed five years ahead of a full leadership transition, as had happened with Xi and Li in 2007. Some had seen Sun as one of those two likely heirs – the other was Guangdong party chief Hu Chunhua, who remains in power – and the decision to bring him down now brought “intense uncertainty about how the game will be played in the future”, Shirk said. “I think that has got to make the people at the top ranks of the Chinese communist party very uneasy about the risks that presents.”As with much about Chinese politics, the exact nature of Sun’s alleged crimes remains murky, as does the political rationale behind his defenestration.The first hint of his undoing came when one of Xi’s feared corruption-busting teams descended on Chongqing late last year. In its subsequent report the group accused his administration of failing to eliminate the poisonous and pernicious “ideological legacy” of Bo Xilai, a bitter Xi rival, who had been ousted five years earlier after the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood sparked China’s biggest political scandal in decades. Then, in mid-July, came the unexpected and unexplained announcement that Sun had been replaced by a Xi loyalist who vowed to purify the city’s “political ecosystem”. Sun is rumoured to have been taken into custody while attending a conference in Beijing.Cheng Li, the director of the Brookings Institute’s China Center, said it was unclear if Sun was facing accusations of corruption or political offences such as conspiring against Xi: “It could be either – or both.”Many believe Xi, who some suspect hopes to stay in power beyond 2022, viewed Sun as a power-hungry competitor who had to be eliminated. Li, an authority on the Communist party’s elite, said that even before the purge: “I have talked to many people who know Sun [and they said] … ‘That guy has a very strong personal ambition; you simply cannot believe what he says and what he promises’.“In Chinese, you use the term ‘yóu’ [slippery or cunning].”Bill Bishop, the publisher of the influential Sinocism newsletter, said Sun’s demise was further proof that Xi – who took power in 2012 and has been called China’s most dominant leader since Mao – was a masterful and steely political strategist.As he sought to cement his status as China’s omnipotent ‘Chairman of Everything’, Xi was using anti-corruption investigators to pick off rivals, who were replaced with supporters. Sun’s successor in Chongqing, Chen Min’er, who worked under Xi during his five years as Zhejiang province’s party boss, now appears poised to claim a seat at the party’s top table at this autumn’s congress.“Xi certainly looks like he would make Machiavelli – and Mao – quite proud,” Bishop said.Shirk, the chair of the 21st Century China Centre at the University of California, San Diego, said she saw Sun’s downfall not as as sign of Xi’s strength, but of the fragility of China’s political system. “If [Xi] upturns the smooth succession now, I think he’s setting himself up for trouble, for some pushback from the rest of the party elite.“If they feel they are being put at risk and the whole party is being put at risk by a leader who is trying to claim too much of the power and privilege for himself, then I think there is a risk.“I’m not saying it is necessarily an elite coup or something like that, but it could be.”For Sun Zhengcai, there is little doubt what now lies ahead.“He’ll end up in jail,” said Li.Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"
70,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to bomb tribal schools, accusing them of teaching students to rebel against the government. Duterte condemned insurgents for destroying infrastructure and alleged that the schools were operated by the rebels without government permits. Human rights groups demanded that Duterte retract the threat and warned such an attack would be a war crime.","President claims tribal schools are teaching students to rebel against the government and says he will launch air strikesAssociated Press

Wed 26 Jul 2017 00.54 EDT

The Philippine president has sparked alarm among human rights groups after he threatened to bomb tribal schools, accusing them of teaching students to become communist rebels.In a televised news conference on Monday, Rodrigo Duterte condemned insurgents for destroying bridges and torching schools in the countryside but said they were sparing indigenous Lumad schools, which he alleged were operating under rebel control without government permits. “Get out of there, I’m telling the Lumads now. I’ll have those bombed, including your structures,” the president said. “I will use the armed forces, the Philippine air force. I’ll really have those bombed … because you are operating illegally and you are teaching the children to rebel against government.” Human rights groups called on him to retract the threat, warning such an attack would constitute a war crime. US-based Human Rights Watch said international humanitarian law “prohibits attacks on schools and other civilian structures unless they are being used for military purposes”, adding that deliberate attacks on civilians, including students and teachers, “is also a war crime”.Leftwing lawmaker Emmi de Jesus of the Gabriela Women’s party asked Duterte to retract the threat, saying government troops may use it as a pretext to attack indigenous schools and communities in the country’s south that have come under threat from pro-military militias in recent years. Angered by recent communist rebel attacks on government forces, including a road gun battle last week that wounded five members of his elite presidential guards, Duterte has called off peace talks with the Maoist guerrillas and threatened their perceived sympathisers.  “By calling for an attack on schools Duterte is directing the military to commit war crimes,” said Carlos Conde of Human Rights Watch. Conde urged Duterte to sign a 2015 international political statement, the Safe Schools Declaration, that commits governments to supporting the protection of students, teachers and schools in times of armed conflict. Duterte ascended to the presidency in 2016 after campaigning on his extra-tough approach on crime as a prosecutor and later as mayor of southern Davao city. He has remained popular despite thousands of deaths in his nationwide anti-drug crackdown, and his continuing popularity and the ineffective opposition have apparently emboldened him. On Monday night Duterte also called for abolishing the Commission on Human Rights, an independent agency created under the constitution. He demanded that the commission and the government ombudsman, who investigates officials for corruption and other infractions, route requests to investigate police and military personnel through him, and laid down conditions under which he would allow those investigations. Duterte said that if the ombudsman failed to address atrocities committed by insurgents on government forces, “so that you can get the truth and the whole story, then do not investigate my army and police.” "

Almost 40% of corporate investments channelled away from authorities and into tax havens travel through the UK or the Netherlands, according to a study of the ownership structures of 98m firms.The two EU states are way ahead of the rest of the world in terms of being a preferred option for corporations who want to exploit tax havens to protect their investments.The Netherlands was a conduit for 23% of corporate investments that ended in a tax haven, a team of researchers at the University of Amsterdam concluded. The UK accounted for 14%, ahead of Switzerland (6%), Singapore (2%) and Ireland (1%).Every year multinationals avoid paying £38bn-£158bn in taxes in the EU using tax havens. In the US, tax evasion by multinational corporations via offshore jurisdictions is estimated to be at least $130bn (£99bn) a year. The researchers reported that there were 24 so-called “sink” offshore financial centres where foreign capital was ultimately stored, safe from the tax authorities.Of those, 18 are said to have a current or past dependence to the UK, such as the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and Jersey.The tax havens used correlated heavily to which conduit country was chosen by the multinational’s accountants.The UK is a major conduit for investments going to European countries and former members of the British Empire, such as Hong Kong, Jersey, Guernsey or Bermuda, reflecting the historical links and tax treaties enjoyed by firms setting up in Britain. The Netherlands is a principal conduit for investment ending in Cyprus and Bermuda, among others. Switzerland is used as a conduit to Jersey. Ireland is the route for Japanese and American companies to Luxembourg.In terms of the purpose, on paper, of the corporate structures, the Netherlands specialises in providing holding companies. The UK provides head offices and fund management and Ireland offers financial leasing and the provision of head offices.“Our results show that offshore finance is not the exclusive business of exotic small islands far away,” the researchers write in an article for theacademic journal Scientific Reports. “Countries such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom play a crucial yet previously hidden role as conduits of offshore finance on its way to tax havens.”Dr Eelke Heemskerk, who led the research, said that the work showed the importance of developed countries cleaning up their financial sectors.He said: “In the context of Brexit, where you have the UK threatening, unless they get a deal, to change their model to be attractive to companies who want to protect themselves from taxes, well, they are already doing it.“The Netherlands says they won’t let the UK be an offshore tax haven. That’s because they don’t want them taking their business.”"
73,"Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic has announced he will miss the remaining 2017 season, including the US Open, following an elbow injury. The world number four had retired from his Wimbledon quarter-final, admitting he had been feeling pain in his elbow for 18 months.

Novak Djokovic will miss the rest of the tennis season with a persistent elbow injury and has announced that Andre Agassi has agreed to remain part of his team next year.After 12 months of upheaval on and off the court, speculation had mounted that Djokovic would take an extended break from tennis in order to recover from the right-elbow injury that forced him to retire during his Wimbledon quarter-final against Tomas Berdych. But while the 30-year-old’s decision to listen to medical advice means he will be absent from next month’s US Open, the world No4 vowed to return stronger than ever and expressed his happiness that Agassi will continue to coach him in 2018.“I will take this time to heal and do all the different suggested methods of rehabilitation and healing processes so I can get back on the court as soon as possible,” Djokovic said. “It will take a couple of months at least without a racket and I hope after that I can start to train. I’m looking forward to building my body and my game and my team.“I’m happy to share that Andre Agassi is committed to stay with me next year. I want to thank Andre for being with me this year and sharing his experience and wisdom and I’m looking forward to getting back on the practice courts with him and having him in the box for any big tournaments.”Djokovic’s announcement came exactly a year after Roger Federer cut short his 2016 season with a knee injury. Written off at the time, Federer returned from six months out to win the Australian Open in January and Wimbledon earlier this month.Djokovic, who was speaking in Belgrade, hopes that a similar period of rest will allow him to rediscover his spark. The Serb has struggled ever since completing his career slam at last year’s French Open. He opted for the “shock therapy” of ripping up his coaching team earlier this year before reaching out to Agassi, who joined him at Roland Garros on an exploratory basis, but Djokovic ran out of steam when the elbow problem that has troubled him for 18 months flared up against Berdych at Wimbledon.He has since sought advice from specialists, including the Serbian doctor Zdenko Milinkovic, who said Djokovic is suffering from a “bruised bone due to excessive playing”.Djokovic has won 12 grand slams and has not missed one since making his debut at the 2005 Australian Open. He is set to slip to fifth in the rankings on Monday and could drop out of the top 10 by the end of the year. But Djokovic preferred to focus on the positives after his latest setback.“I’m very grateful, that’s the strongest emotion I’m feeling lately, even though as a professional it is not an easy decision to swallow,” he said.“I haven’t skipped any big tournament. I have played all the grand slams and probably 90% of the 1000 Masters series events. I was blessed to have a lot of success. I’m grateful for that. But I’m also very grateful that I kept my body very healthy throughout the years. I haven’t had too many injuries and especially no big injuries like this one that would keep me away from the tour for longer than a month.“It’s a new experience for me, new circumstances, but I’m trying to look at it from a brighter side. I have time where I can dedicate myself to healing and building up my body and strength and focusing on certain elements of my game that I never had time to work on. Now I have time to perfect it and build the foundations for the next five years or more. I really want to play professional tennis for years to come.”"

MTV has announced the nominees for the 2017 Video Music Awards, eliminating the gendered categories of years past and combining the awards for best male and female video into one category, artist of the year.The rapper Kendrick Lamar led the pack with eight nominations for the music video for Humble, while the Weeknd and Katy Perry were not far behind with five nods each. The nominees for the evening’s top prize, artist of the year, are Lamar, the Weeknd, Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, Ariana Grande and Lorde.The awards ceremony, which will take place on 27 August at the Forum in Inglewood, California, and will air on MTV that night, has always been a haven of controversy, having played host to some of the most infamous pop culture moments of the past decade, including Britney Spears’ and Madonna’s notorious onstage kiss and Miley Cyrus’s risque 2013 performance with Robin Thicke.For its movie and TV awards, which aired in May, MTV decided to combine the categories of best actor and actress, doing away with distinctions between genders and opting instead to award one film and one television actor. This year’s winners were Emma Watson and Millie Bobby Brown.At the time, MTV general manager Amy Doyle told the Hollywood Reporter: “Great acting is great acting, no matter what the gender or non-gender. And it really is reflective about the audience’s views and when you look at the culture as a whole, you had a man against a woman running for president [last year]. It just felt like a dated construct for a category.”Rihanna also earned several nominations for Wild Thoughts, her collaboration with DJ Khaled and Bryson Tiller, while SZA and Kodak Black were both nominated for best new artist. The VMAs also introduced a new category – best fight against the system – awarding music videos that “inspire viewers to stand up and fight injustice”. In that category, Logic, Alessia Cara, John Legend, Big Sean and the Hamilton Mixtape all earned nominations.At the 2016 VMAs, Beyoncé went home with eight awards from 11 nominations, while Rihanna was awarded the video vanguard award after performing a medley of her hits."

Adam Peaty surprised even himself after improving his own 50 metres breaststroke world record by almost half a second in one day at the world championships in Budapest on Tuesday.The Olympic champion won 100m breaststroke gold on Monday’s second day and vowed there would be “something special” over one length on Tuesday. But even the 22-year-old did not expect what happened – a 0.47sec improvement on the world record of 26.42sec he set in winning the 50m title in Kazan, Russia in 2015.Peaty clocked 26.10 in the morning heat, 0.44 ahead of his nearest rival, and improved his mark to 25.95 in the evening semi-final, 0.73sec clear of the field.“I didn’t think I was going to do that,” said Peaty, who shook his head in disbelief after seeing his time. Peaty, though, knows what matters is the title , when he will likely also be part of the British 4x100m mixed medley relay team seeking to win successive golds after victory in 2015. He added: “I enjoyed it tonight. Obviously it’s nothing without the gold that goes along with it.“I’m going to be focusing now, staying neutral and see what we get tomorrow.” Peaty’s advantage is a huge margin over two lengths of the pool, let alone one. But he is focused on himself, having learned from experience since 2014 and winning Commonwealth, European, world and Olympic titles.“This morning I wasn’t prepared to do a world record,” Peaty added.“It was just me easing through the stroke and touching the wall. Progressing to the semi-final. It was the same tonight. I was on such a massive high from this morning and it was so hard to ignore the fact that I did a world record and try to get myself emotionally ready. I thought I was going to go slower [in the semi-final] because I was a little bit less energetic.”Peaty has the five fastest times in history over 50m breaststroke, a non-Olympic event, and admitted a sub-26sec swim had not been on his radar, with his focus on what he calls Project 56 – swimming beneath 57sec over 100m, since Rio. He said: “This morning everyone was like Project 25 and I was like ‘go on then’. I just dived in tonight and was like ‘I feel good’. I wasn’t that far behind after the start, which was a bonus for me.”Peaty surfaces sooner than his rivals, but so he is so powerful that he surges through the water.Cameron van der Burgh of South Africa, Peaty’s predecessor as world champion in 2013, clocked 26.54 in the morning heat, but finished his semi-final in 26.74 as Brazil’s Felipe Lima beat him in 26.68. Peaty is likely to be kept in reserve in the morning heats of the mixed medley relay, with Ross Murdoch an able deputy, and, assuming they qualify, Britain will be confident of success with Peaty coming in for an event which is now on the Olympic programme.Duncan Scott and James Guy earlier missed out on adding to Britain’s medal collection, which included Ben Proud’s 50m butterfly gold on Monday.. Scott and Guy had to settle for fourth and fifth place, respectively, in the 200m freestyle as the Olympic champion Sun Yang of China won his second gold, after 400m victory on Sunday. The Britons’ semi-final times would have been good enough for the podium. “It’s very disappointing. I think I got a little bit carried away at the start of the race,” Guy said.Scott, who begins his 100m freestyle campaign on Wednesday, said: “I’m proud of that swim. I don’t think I did anything wrong, just others stepped up and performed when they needed to.”Kathleen Dawson was eighth in the 100m backstroke won by Canada’s Kylie Masse in a world record time of 58.10. And Sarah Vasey was eighth in the 100m breaststroke as the Olympic champion Lilly King of the United States won in 1:04.13."

The House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted on Tuesday to approve new sanctions on Russia, setting up a potential showdown with the White House.By a 419-3 vote, the House approved a bill to that would levy new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea. It combines new measures targeting Russia for its interference in the 2016 election, as well as provisions intended to curb North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and Iranian militarism.Only three libertarian-leaning Republicans – Justin Amash of Michigan, Tom Massie of Kentucky and Jimmy Duncan of Tennessee – voted against the bill in the House.The bill had been bogged down in controversy in recent weeks over objections from the Trump administration. The White House has been opposed to a provision in the bill that requires congressional approval for any attempt by the president to lift the sanctions on Russia.An earlier Senate version of the bill passed 98-2, but was only aimed at Russia and Iran. It did not include the measures against North Korea, which are now in the House bill. The latest bill must now return to the Senate, where it is expected to pass easily, before it is sent to Trump.Despite the White House’s opposition to the bill, it is likely to become law. Even if Trump decides to veto the legislation, it has already passed both chambers by veto-proof margins.In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that “while the President supports tough sanctions on North Korea, Iran and Russia, the White House is reviewing the House legislation and awaits a final legislative package for the President’s desk”.The legislation passed the House the same day Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, spoke to the House intelligence committee about the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. Russian interference in the 2016 election is the subject of multiple investigations – including one by special counsel Robert Mueller – as well as committees on Capitol Hill, and questions have been raised in particular about allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has vigorously denied the suggestion that there was any collusion and has repeatedly called the investigations into Russia’s role in the election “a witch hunt”."

A federal judge on Monday cleared the way for Donald Trump’s commission on election fraud to resume collecting detailed voter roll information from the states.The commission asked states last month to provide publicly available data including registered voters’ names, birth dates and partial social security numbers, but it later told them to hold off until a judge ruled on a lawsuit filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (Epic) in Washington. The US district court judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, in the District of Columbia, denied the advocacy group’s request to block the data collection in a ruling that the commission’s vice-chairman, Kris Kobach, called “a major victory for government accountability, transparency and the public’s right to know about the integrity of our elections processes”.“The commission requested this publicly available data as part of its fact-gathering process, which is information that states regularly release to political candidates, political parties and the general public,” said Kobach, the Republican secretary of state in Kansas. “We look forward to continuing to work with state election leaders to gather information and identify opportunities to improve election integrity.” Nearly two weeks ago, the Trump administration had appeared to back away from its extraordinary attempt to gather voters’ personal information, following a barrage of legal challenges and furious backlash from state officials as well as the public over privacy concerns. In addition, while Kobach has said that the effort was aimed at stopping voter fraud, his detractors say he is looking for a solution to a non-existent problem. They have also accused him of using it as a backdoor effort at mass voter suppression.The privacy group had argued in its suit that the commission should have completed an assessment of privacy concerns before making the request. The judge found that the group had standing to make that argument but said the commission was not an agency and therefore was not required to do such assessments. The judge also found the group failed to show that its members would be harmed by the data collection. “The only practical harm the plaintiff’s advisory board members would suffer ... is that their already publicly available information would be rendered more easily accessible by virtue of its consolidation on the computer systems that would ultimately receive this information on behalf of the commission,” the judge said. She did not say that any states must comply with the commission’s request. The privacy group said it would be watching closely to see what the commission did next. “The commission cannot evade privacy obligations by playing a shell game with the nation’s voting records,” Epic’s president, Marc Rotenberg, said. Similar lawsuits are pending in Texas, Florida and New Hampshire. The New Hampshire lawsuit, brought by two lawmakers and an American Civil Liberties Union chapter, was put on hold pending the outcome of the Washington case. Trump, a Republican, created the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May to investigate his allegations, offered without evidence, that millions of people voted illegally in 2016. At the panel’s first meeting last week, he questioned the motives of states that have refused to comply with the commission’s request, suggesting they had something to hide. Before the commission paused data collection earlier this month, an Associated Press count of states’ responses found 17, plus Washington DC, did not plan to provide any information. Election officials in some of those states questioned the commission’s intent to search for voter fraud; in some states, the main concern was voters’ privacy. Thirty states said they would provide limited information that was considered public already. And some of those states said the commission would have some hoops to jump through such as paying for the data or filling out additional request forms. Alabama, Hawaii and Idaho had not announced decisions about whether to comply. "

A new book detailing Nelson Mandela’s last days has been withdrawn after it was condemned by his widow, the publisher Penguin Random House has announced.The book by Mandela’s physician, Vejay Ramlakan, was released last week to coincide with the late South African anti-apartheid leader’s birthday, 18 July, which is marked each year as Mandela Day.It revealed several undignified episodes at the end of Mandela’s life as well as bitter family squabbles over his care and legacy, prompting fury from his widow, Graça Machel, who threatened legal action.On Monday Penguin Random House said it had decided to immediately withdraw the book, Mandela’s Last Years, from the trade. No further copies will be issued.It added that the book “was meant to portray Nelson Mandela’s courage and strength until the very end of his life, and was in no way intended to be disrespectful”.Machel accused Ramlakan, a former military surgeon, of breaching patient confidentiality.The book disclosed that after Mandela’s death at the age of 95, a spy camera was found in the morgue where his body was held.It also revealed that an ambulance transporting Mandela to hospital during his final months caught fire on the highway, forcing him to wait for a backup.His eldest grandson, Mandla Mandela, also criticised the book.Machel said she had not been consulted, though Ramlakan claimed that the book had been approved.“We received permission from the family,” the author told local television eNCA before the withdrawal. “All parties who needed to be consulted were consulted.”“The story of Madiba’s [Mandela’s clan name] last years is actually, in a sense, more impressive than when he was a fit human being,” he added, paying tribute to his “unconquerable fortitude”.Penguin Random House did not say how many copies of the book had already been sold.Mandela married Machel, his third wife and the widow of Mozambique president Samora Machel, in 1998."
87,"Britain's 22-year-old Adam Peaty broke his own world record for the 50m breaststroke to set a new one at the World Aquatics Championships on Tuesday. Peaty swam the 50m in 26.10 seconds, eclipsing the 26.42 seconds he produced at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships. Notably, Peaty also won Britain a gold in the 100 metres breaststroke.","Adam Peaty surprised even himself after improving his own 50 metres breaststroke world record by almost half a second in one day at the world championships in Budapest on Tuesday.The Olympic champion won 100m breaststroke gold on Monday’s second day and vowed there would be “something special” over one length on Tuesday. But even the 22-year-old did not expect what happened – a 0.47sec improvement on the world record of 26.42sec he set in winning the 50m title in Kazan, Russia in 2015.Peaty clocked 26.10 in the morning heat, 0.44 ahead of his nearest rival, and improved his mark to 25.95 in the evening semi-final, 0.73sec clear of the field.“I didn’t think I was going to do that,” said Peaty, who shook his head in disbelief after seeing his time. Peaty, though, knows what matters is the title , when he will likely also be part of the British 4x100m mixed medley relay team seeking to win successive golds after victory in 2015. He added: “I enjoyed it tonight. Obviously it’s nothing without the gold that goes along with it.“I’m going to be focusing now, staying neutral and see what we get tomorrow.” Peaty’s advantage is a huge margin over two lengths of the pool, let alone one. But he is focused on himself, having learned from experience since 2014 and winning Commonwealth, European, world and Olympic titles.“This morning I wasn’t prepared to do a world record,” Peaty added.“It was just me easing through the stroke and touching the wall. Progressing to the semi-final. It was the same tonight. I was on such a massive high from this morning and it was so hard to ignore the fact that I did a world record and try to get myself emotionally ready. I thought I was going to go slower [in the semi-final] because I was a little bit less energetic.”Peaty has the five fastest times in history over 50m breaststroke, a non-Olympic event, and admitted a sub-26sec swim had not been on his radar, with his focus on what he calls Project 56 – swimming beneath 57sec over 100m, since Rio. He said: “This morning everyone was like Project 25 and I was like ‘go on then’. I just dived in tonight and was like ‘I feel good’. I wasn’t that far behind after the start, which was a bonus for me.”Peaty surfaces sooner than his rivals, but so he is so powerful that he surges through the water.Cameron van der Burgh of South Africa, Peaty’s predecessor as world champion in 2013, clocked 26.54 in the morning heat, but finished his semi-final in 26.74 as Brazil’s Felipe Lima beat him in 26.68. Peaty is likely to be kept in reserve in the morning heats of the mixed medley relay, with Ross Murdoch an able deputy, and, assuming they qualify, Britain will be confident of success with Peaty coming in for an event which is now on the Olympic programme.Duncan Scott and James Guy earlier missed out on adding to Britain’s medal collection, which included Ben Proud’s 50m butterfly gold on Monday.. Scott and Guy had to settle for fourth and fifth place, respectively, in the 200m freestyle as the Olympic champion Sun Yang of China won his second gold, after 400m victory on Sunday. The Britons’ semi-final times would have been good enough for the podium. “It’s very disappointing. I think I got a little bit carried away at the start of the race,” Guy said.Scott, who begins his 100m freestyle campaign on Wednesday, said: “I’m proud of that swim. I don’t think I did anything wrong, just others stepped up and performed when they needed to.”Kathleen Dawson was eighth in the 100m backstroke won by Canada’s Kylie Masse in a world record time of 58.10. And Sarah Vasey was eighth in the 100m breaststroke as the Olympic champion Lilly King of the United States won in 1:04.13."

On their way back, once Kovind has taken his oath, the two will exchange seats, leaving Mukherjee on the right and Kovind on the left.This buggy has interesting history at its tail. Here's where it comes from:WHERE DID THE BUGGY COME FROM?The gold-plated, horse-drawn buggy originally belonged to the Viceroy of India during the British era. How it remained in India after Independence is a story that will make many happy.After the partition, both India and Pakistan wanted the fancy buggy, and there was no longer a higher power to sort this quarrel.So, what did they do to sort the dispute?Simple. They did what cricket captains do these days. They tossed.Lt Col Thakur Govind Singh from India and Pakistan Army's Sahabzada Yaqub Khan let the responsibility of the buggy ownership rest on a coin.Guess who won the toss?Of course, India did. And here we are, after all these years, still using the old gal to flaunt around our newly-elected presidents.BUGGY'S USEAfter 1984, the buggy was not frequently used by any president for a few decades. While they did use it now and then, it was properly used again in 2014 by Pranab Mukherjee.Earlier, the gold-plated buggy was used by the president not only for ceremonial purposes, but also to move around in his 320-acre residential space.Over the years, as the president's security grew tighter, the use of the buggy lessened, limited to ceremonial formalities at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.However, with President Mukherjee's term, the buggy was brought back into action.

Homeopathic remedies will no longer be available on prescription on the NHS according to newly-announced plans.The move comes as part of the NHS England’s drive to save more than £190m a year through a new set of national guidelines, which are now open for public consultation. According to the draft consultation, prescriptions for homeopathic treatments cost NHS England £92,412 in 2016, and at least £578,000 over the past five years.Announcing the plans, Simon Stevens, NHS England’s chief executive, said homeopathy is “at best a placebo and a misuse of scarce NHS funds”.Besides homeopathy, the plans highlight 17 other items that will no longer be available on prescription for reasons ranging from low clinical effectiveness to low cost-effectiveness. These include herbal medicines, Omega-3 fatty acid compounds, rubs and ointments used to relieve muscle pain known as rubefacients, and travel vaccines including hepatitis B, yellow fever and rabies that are not available on the NHS for travel, but are sometimes erroneously given.The public funding of homeopathic remedies has long been controversial, with both the British Medical Association and the House of Commons’ science and technology committee having called for an end to their prescription on NHS, pointing out that such remedies are merely placebos. The new guidelines were welcomed by experts.“Homeopathy is based on implausible assumptions and the most reliable evidence fails to show that it works beyond a placebo effect. It can cause severe harm when used as an alternative to effective treatments,” said Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter. “Therefore, it is high time that the NHS stops funding it and instead employs our scarce resources on treatments that are backed by sound science.”The view was echoed by Michael Marshall, project director of the Good Thinking Society, an organisation that previously threatened the Department of Health with a judicial review if it failed to put complementary and alternative therapies on the blacklist for prescriptions.“This is very welcome news,” said Marshall. “Every credible medical body certainly knows that homeopathic remedies are just not effective for any conditions at all and it is great to see this strong statement from NHS England officially acknowledging the fact.” Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, said that an honest conversation about public funding of drugs was needed. “We need to end unnecessary expense to give us a bigger therapeutic bang for the NHS buck, so we cut the fat and build the therapeutic muscle,” he said.A spokeswoman for the BMA said the organisation “believes there should be no further NHS funding for homeopathy” adding that “limited and scarce NHS resources should only be used to support medicines and treatment that have been shown to be effective.”But Cristal Sumner, chief executive of the British Homeopathic Association said the NHS plans were “bad for its already overstretched budget and for patients” and criticised the report used to draw up the new guidelines.“This recommendation is not cost effective as patients will be prescribed more expensive conventional drugs in place of homeopathy, which defeats the object of the exercise,” she said.Meanwhile, NHS England has been accused of introducing “ability to pay” through the back door by forcing patients to pay for other products it claims are “ineffective, over-priced and low value”, instead of giving prescriptions for them. Health charities claim the NHS is abandoning the historic principle that people who need care should not have to pay. The charge has been made today by National Voices, an umbrella group that represents 140 health and care charities including the British Heart Foundation, Parkinson’s UK and Arthritis Care. It was responding to NHS England’s announcement that it wants to cut its drugs bill by several hundred million pounds by no longer issuing prescriptions for cough mixture, cold treatments, eye drops, laxatives and sun cream – products that are available over the counter. NHS bosses want those in need to pay for such medications themselves. “There are many patients who would be unable to afford the remedies over the counter – for example people who are exempt from prescription charges such as the under-16s, people living with cancer, pregnant women and those on low incomes”, said Don Redding, National Voices’ director of policy. “Stopping such prescriptions would be tantamount to introducing ‘ability to pay’ as a barrier to accessing the treatments people need. This breaks with the principle of ‘free at the point of use’ guaranteed by the NHS constitution.” The NHS constitution states that: “Access to NHS services is based on clinical need, not an individual’s ability to pay; NHS services are free of charge, except in limited circumstances sanctioned by parliament.” "

I apologise to the city of Verona, to all the fans, to the president.“For a 35-year-old man I need to be motivated and at this moment I feel that my priority is represented by being close to my children and my wife.”Earlier on Monday the Verona president, Maurizio Setti, had confirmed Cassano’s departure with immediate effect. “This guy’s head isn’t right, even though he’s very good physically and athletically. He’ll leave,” Setti told ANSA.“Professionally, you can’t accuse him of doing anything wrong. Evidently, he can’t remain serene and clearheaded in a group and wants to stay at home. There’s an up and a down with him, he talks and then he’s silent. It’s a shame because he was doing everything well in a professional sense.”Cassano has been without a club since his contract with Sampdoria was terminated by mutual consent in January 2015."

A new public swimming area on Paris’s Canal de l’Ourcq has reopened after it was temporarily closed due to higher than normal bacteria levels following weekend rains.The floating structure that has been put in place for the summer has allowed Parisians to legally swim in the canal at La Villette for the first time in decades. It proved very popular when it opened this month and was hailed by the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, as the beginning of a “dream” to launch open swimming areas in other city waterways, including on the river Seine in 2024 if Paris succeeds in its bid to host the Olympics that year.The swimming area was briefly closed on Monday after a routine test on Sunday night found higher than normal levels of enterococci, bacteria found in faecal matter. The city of Paris tweeted that the pool was closed because the water quality was “unsatisfactory”.The pool reopened on Tuesday morning after subsequent tests found the water quality was back to normal. It is thought that heavy rainfall at the weekend had led to the higher than normal readings of bacteria levels.Tests are regularly made at a point upstream from the swimming area to ensure the water quality is within guidelines. After a 10-year effort by the city to clean up the canal water, regular tests had consistently come back with satisfactory results showing the bacteria levels were far below accepted limits. Authorities said they would keep testing regularly during the swimming season.A spokeswoman for the Paris authorities said: “Tests carried out on Monday night showed that the levels are now back in line with the requirements, so we have reopened the pool. It’s nothing serious. The water quality is good.”The floating pool structure, which can take up to 300 swimmers at a time, proved an instant hit after opening this month, and when Paris temperatures rose well above 30C, hundreds of people queued each day to get in.Inaugurating the facility, Hidalgo called it “a dream come true”. The mayor has set a target of 2024, when the city hopes to host the summer Olympics, to have swimming areas at designated points along the Seine.After decades in which casual bathing in Paris’s river and canals was banned for many reasons, including strong currents, fears of bacteria and sewage pollution, authorities are moving to give swimmers more access.In recent years, lone swimmers could regularly be seen taking dips in the canal at La Villette of their own accord, despite the “no swimming” signs.The official pool structure, opened by city hall at La Villette for the summer as part of the Paris Plages festival, marks the first time in many years that swimmers can legally swim there.A witness said he heard gunshots and saw Paris police officers in tears Paris after a police employee, who stabbed and killed four colleagues, was shot dead on Thursday"

A man who injured several people with a chainsaw when he stormed the office of an insurance company in the Swiss town of Schaffhausen on Monday morning remains at large as over a hundred police officers are engaged in a man-hunt along the Swiss-German border.One person was seriously hurt and four others sustained light injuries when Swiss citizen Franz Wrousis, 51, went on a rampage at the offices of CSS, a leading health insurance company. Authorities on Monday afternoon downgraded earlier reports of two victims with serious injuries.Police believe the attack was directly targeted at the insurance company but could not comment further on a possible motive while the attacker remained on the run.“This is not an attack against a hypothetical person. This is clearly against people from the insurer,” Major Ravi Landolt of the police told a news conference.Police spokesperson Cindy Beer confirmed that the incident was not being treated as a terrorist attack.Emergency services had been informed of the incident at 10.39am (0839 GMT) but found that the perpetrator had left the scene of the crime by the time police arrived.Schaffhausen’s old town has been sealed off as police continue to search for the perpetrator in the centre and vicinity of Switzerland’s northernmost city.Wrousis, described as an approximately 1.9m tall male, bald and of “unkempt appearance”, was already known to police in relation with two offences against the country’s weapons law, in 2014 and 2016. Police were able to release several close-up pictures of the wanted man.Having previously been registered in the canton of Graubünden, Wrousis had recently been without fixed abode and is believed to have lived in a stretch of forest 2km outside Schaffhausen.The municipal mayor said Wrousis had left a confused impression on the local population: “He told my dog that he had a great haircut,” Ruedi Karre told news portal 24 Minuten.A white Volkswagen Caddy vehicle with a Graubünden number plate previously used by Wrousis was later discovered in the city.Schaffhausen state prosecutor Peter Stichler appealed for caution among the local population, saying that Wrousis could act aggressively when cornered.

Manchester City have taken their summer spending to more than £200m with the signing of Benjamin Mendy from Monaco and increased their total outlay in the transfer market since Pep Guardiola took charge 13 months ago to £385m.The transfer fee of £52m (€57.5m) for Mendy is a world record for a defender and is Guardiola’s latest signal of intent as he seeks to build a squad capable of winning major silverware in his second season at the Etihad Stadium.City’s spending is closing in on Real Madrid’s record for money outlayed in a single transfer window by one club, set when the Spanish club spent €257m (£230m) in the summer of 2009 bringing in Xabi Alonso, Karim Benzema, Kaká and Cristiano Ronaldo.Mendy, who has signed a five-year contract with City, had been identified as a key target by Guardiola following the departure of the left-back Gaël Clichy at the end of last season and Aleksandar Kolarov, who left for Roma last week after seven years at the club. His signing completes a transformation of City’s defence since Guardiola’s appointment last summer.City confirmed over the weekend the £26.5m switch from Real Madrid of Danilo, who is expected to provide cover for the first-choice full-backs Mendy and the £45m signing from Tottenham Hotspur, Kyle Walker. They will line up alongside other expensive arrivals including the centre-back John Stones, signed last season for £47m, and the £34.9m goalkeeper Ederson from Benfica.The signing of Mendy, in particular, is a statement not only of City’s financial firepower but also of Guardiola’s determination to build the kind of ruthless attacking machine which he developed at Barcelona and Bayern Munich.Mendy, 23, came through Le Havre’s youth system before a move to Marseille in 2013. He switched to Monaco last summer for £11m where he established himself as one of the best full-backs in the world with his powerful and direct style of play as the club claimed the French title and reached the Champions League semi-finals.Like Walker, Mendy is at his most effective going forward and City will hope the duo can add a surge of energy in wide areas that was lacking last season; Guardiola received some criticism for switching between four and three at the back and deploying his full-backs in unfamiliar roles tucked into midfield. City’s new recruits indicate a move towards a more typical and consistent four-man defence, although Mendy and Walker are comfortable at wing-back.Mendy will join City’s squad in Los Angeles where Guardiola’s side are preparing to face Real Madrid in the International Champions Cup .“I am absolutely delighted to be joining Manchester City,” Mendy said. “They are one of Europe’s leading clubs and in Pep Guardiola they have a manager committed to playing attacking football. I am sure that over the next few years we will be successful.”Txiki Begiristain, City’s director of football, said: “Benjamin has all the qualities we are looking for in a full-back. For such a young player he has a wealth of top-level experience. He is undoubtedly one of the world’s best full-backs, our No1 target in this position. We are all delighted to have him here at Manchester City.”"

Cash-strapped holidaymakers are making their toddlers drag suitcases onboard planes to escape baggage fees, according to Ryanair bosses.Fewer passengers than ever are checking bags into the aircraft hold. Instead, travellers are avoiding charges by bringing more and more luggage into the cabin.Ryanair’s chief financial officer, Neil Sorahan, said the airline could review its second bag allowance, introduced in late 2013, as passengers were starting to “take the piss”.He said: “I’ve seen two-year-olds wheeling a bag up to the plane as people try to take advantage.” Fewer than one passenger in six now pays to check in luggage on Ryanair. Fares have been driven down as airlines compete to fill their planes; Ryanair is forecasting a further 7% fall in the next 12 months following a 13% drop in average fares from 2016 to 2017. But it can cost more to check in a bag than purchase a seat, with prices typically up to £90 extra for a 20kg suitcase on a return short-haul summer flight. A two-year-old is entitled, like adults, to bring a 10kg suitcase and a second small bag for free. A one-year-old’s cabin allowance can also account for up to 5kg of the family’s total packing, according to a Ryanair spokesman. The airline admitted its takings were falling as passengers looked to squeeze ever more into the cabin, although it made a healthy €443m (£396m) profit in the last three months. Sorahan said: “We’re very generous with our cabin baggage allowance; a 10kg case and a second small carry-on. If everyone does that there’s no issue. It’s the people coming with the kitchen sink that could change the policy.”Asked by a reporter if passengers were “taking the piss”, Sorahan said: “Some are... The vast majority of people play by the rules but some don’t. Unfortunately some bring massive backpacks and things that don’t fit under the seat. We’ve been a little bit lax or nice – we are victims of our own niceness.”Ryanair passengers who do arrive with oversized bags risk being told to put them in the hold and charged an extra £50 at the airport."

Scarce rain and chronically leaky aqueducts have combined to put Romans at risk of drastic water rationing as soon as this week.Sky TG24 TV meteorologists noted on Sunday that Italy had experienced one of its driest springs in some 60 years and that some parts of the country had seen rainfall totals 80% below normal. Among the hardest-hit regions was Sardinia, which is seeking natural disaster status.Farmers’ lobby Coldiretti last week estimated €2bn ($2.3bn) worth of damage had been done to Italian agriculture so far. Dairy farmers are lamenting drops in milk production. Among those suffering are farmers growing canning tomatoes in the southeastern region of Puglia, wine grapes throughout much of Italy and those cultivating olives – all signature crops for the nation.Another afflicted area was the province in Parma, an area in north-central Italy renowned for Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and prized prosciutto.Rome’s water supply worries have turned political. Last week, the governor of Lazio region, which includes the Italian capital, ordered that no more water be drawn from Lake Bracciano, which supplies some of the Italian capital, because the drastically decreasing water level posed danger to the aquatic life of the lake.The lake, 40km from Rome, used to be used only for backup water supply but recent years have seen it being tapped on a regular basis.Rome water company ACEA warned that without the lake, drastic rationing loomed. Italian media said staggered water supply shutdowns could last as long as eight hours daily in alternating neighbourhoods and start as soon as Wednesday. Rome’s famed fountains risk being turned off.The move put populist 5-Star Movement Mayor Virginia Raggi under pressure, since the city of Rome is a major shareholder in Acea. Michele Meta, a Democratic party lawmaker from Rome, demanded to know why Acea “doesn’t have other solutions besides rationing and staggering the capital’s water” supply?Rome had 26 rainy days in this year’s first six months, compared to 88 in the first half of 2016, with precipitation totals in those same periods more than four times higher last year than this year.But water supply pipelines in the Rome area – famed in ancient Roman times for its aqueducts, segments of which still stand – are notoriously leaky.La Stampa daily reported on Sunday that water, energy and environment companies lobby Utilitalia analysed companies serving roughly half of Italy’s population and concluded that the water loss rate from inadequate infrastructure, often decades-old, ranged from 26% in the north to 46% in the central and southern parts of the country."

Microsoft’s next Windows 10 update, called the Autumn (or Fall in the US) Creators Update, will bring a variety of new features. But one long-standing stalwart of the Windows experience has been put on the chopping block: Microsoft Paint.First released with the very first version of Windows 1.0 in 1985, Paint in its various guises would be one of the first graphics editors used by many and became a core part of Windows. Starting life as a 1-bit monochrome licensed version of ZSoft’s PC Paintbrush, it wasn’t until Windows 98 that Paint could save in JPEG.With the Windows 10 Creators Update, released in April, Microsoft introduced the new Paint 3D, which is installed alongside traditional Paint and features 3D image making tools as well as some basic 2D image editing. But it is not an update to original Paint and doesn’t behave like it.Now Microsoft has announced that, alongside Outlook Express, Reader app and Reading list, Microsoft Paint has been signalled for death having been added to the “features that are removed or deprecated in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update” list.Falling under the deprecated column for apps that are “not in active development and might be removed in future releases”, Microsoft Paint’s ticket has been called and now it’s only a matter of time before it is removed like your favourite piece of old furniture from your childhood home.Paint was never one of the most capable apps, and was limited to the bitmap (BMP) and PCX formats until 1998, but if you wanted to scribble something out using your mouse or make a quick cut and paste job, Paint was always there, even on work computers.The most recent version of Paint for Windows 7 and later was much improved, but still considered feature poor compared to other free alternatives such as the third-party Paint.NET.When Microsoft Paint will officially be removed from Windows has yet to be confirmed, while a precise date for the release of the Windows 10 Autumn Creators Update is equally up in the air. Whether, like Clippy, Windows users will celebrate or decry Paint’s removal, it will be a moment in the history of Windows as one of its longest-standing apps is put out to pasture."

The French capital was in lockdown on Sunday, with extra rings of security around the Champs Élysées, which had been turned into a vast sterile zone as a foretaste of what awaits the French capital when the Olympics arrive in either 2024 or 2028. In an understandable attempt to put Paris on display as never before, the race was routed through the Grand Palais with the riders racing under the famous glass roof, originally erected in 1897 for the universal exposition of the turn of the century.For Chris Froome it was but a novel diversion en route to confirmation of his fourth Tour de France victory. The Team Sky rider crossed the line in the bunch behind the stage winner, Dylan Groenewegen, to win the yellow jersey by 54 seconds from Rigoberto Urán.Bike races have been sent through buildings before – there is a legendary kermis in Belgium which went through a bar full of drinkers and cyclo-cross races are sometimes sent through beer tents – but this was about more than merely upping the returns in adjacent brasseries. Coming as it did the day after the start and finish in Marseille’s Stade Vélodrome – albeit far from full due to the fact that few ticket holders wanted to stay in the stands all day – the Grand Palais detour was further evidence that the Tour is constantly looking for new ways to reinvent itself, and a reminder that it increasingly sees itself as a way of showing this multifaceted country to the world.Lockdown could serve as a metaphor for the Tour as a whole, given the way the overall battle had panned out since the race left Düsseldorf 22 days ago. In four of the five previous Tours, Team Sky had brought their cycling version of catenaccio to bear on the race, but they had never done so to the extent they managed this year, with the yellow jersey only eluding them for two days once Geraint Thomas had won the opening time trial. For kilometre after kilometre the white train ground out the pace on the front, up hill and down dale, at times lining out the entire race when on paper it was not strictly necessary.As Froome’s fourth win loomed large, it was inevitable that at least one French newspaper – Le Figaro, as it turned out – would describe the Tour winner using Antoine Blondin’s sublime pun, “gérant de la route” – a wordplay on the verb gérer, meaning to manage or regulate, and the hoary French cliche for the Tour riders, les géants de la route. An English translation might be accountancy on wheels. Or to paraphrase Geoff Nicholson, hoarding seconds like supermarket discount coupons.Froome himself said that this was his and Team Sky’s chosen approach. “We knew in Düsseldorf that it would be tight. It was always the tactic to ride this as a three-week race, not to go out on one day to blow it up, smash it for the stage win … just chipping away every stage to make sure there were no massive losses. That’s normal when on a bad day in the mountains you can lose minutes. It’s been about doing it in the most conservative and efficient manner. That’s what Grand Tour racing is.”Compare and contrast with Dan Martin, who treats the key days like individual one-day classics, but – before you veer too strongly towards espousing Martin’s philosophy – bear in mind who actually won.Fourth Tour wins are the penultimate step to cycling greatness, but often do little to warm the soul at the time. This could certainly be said of the three that I can personally recall: Lance Armstrong in 2002 (with the usual proviso that it has been struck off), Miguel Indurain in 1994 and Bernard Hinault in 1982. They seem to be ones for the record books rather than the heart, but they can be turned by an individual’s approach. Hinault, in 1982, faced the same issue that confronted Froome as he approached Paris on Sunday: a Tour without a stage win, and the consequent carps about a lack of panache.The Badger’s response was to win the bunch sprint on the Champs Élysées, but this is not one from the Froome copybook. Having said that, Froome’s great strength over his four victories is his ability to adapt to whatever the Tour organisers present to him, and whatever fate decrees. 2013 had a wealth of time trialling and an immensely tough finale in the Alps; in 2015 there were cobbles and a team time trial but barely any individual time trials, while in 2016 there was more time trialling and a downhill finale into Morzine, in teeming rain, not to mention the run up Mont Ventoux.He is a champion who has versatility and grit, if not charisma or popularity. His approach to the latter is summed up by his answer to the question of why he felt he did not need to give press conferences on the rest days. “Rest days are meant to be rest days and a big press conference is not good for recovery. I felt it helped me being able to switch off.” If Froome chooses to pursue a “marginal gain” by hiding from a 15-minute discussion with the people whose job it is to present his personality to the world, he can hardly complain if his personality is not understood or appreciated for what it is. This is the Team Sky approach of winning at all costs; in this case the cost has to be borne by him.For the neutral there was much unbridled bike racing by individuals of character and panache to be savoured through the 2017 Tour, with the unfortunate proviso that very little of it actually involved the battle for the overall title. Some days will live in the memory: the moyenne montagne stage to Les Rousses won by Lilian Calmejane, Steve Cummings’s attempt to take the stage to Peyragudes, Sunweb’s battle with Quick-Step on the road to Romans-sur-Isère on behalf of their sprinters Mike Matthews and Marcel Kittel, Alberto Contador’s raging against the dying of the light en route to Foix and Serre-Chevalier, and Edvald Boasson Hagen’s cunning on Friday at Salon-de-Provence.Two stages can be seen as key episodes in the picaresque three-week soap opera: the Düsseldorf time trial, because of the time gained by Froome, and the message it sent about the probable outcome in Marseille three weeks later, and Chambéry, with the crash that eliminated Richie Porte – whose BMC team looked second strongest to Sky – and which put Daniel Martin physically and temporally on the back foot for the rest of the race.What of the opposition? They fell upon a Froome who was probably not as strong as in the past, but who had the nous, the sangfroid and the team to get him cycling’s greatest prize. “At the moment we’re not ready to beat Chris Froome. Most teams aren’t,” said Orica-Scott’s director sportive Matt White, who placed a Yates brother in the top 10 and the white jersey of best under-25 for the second year running.“We’ll be coming back with a leader next year to try to beat Chris. Everyone is beatable. The model that Sky run and how they race makes it difficult. I’ve no idea what it’s a sign of but this year in general we haven’t seen him at the level of the past. That level was still good enough to win the Tour de France, and that shows the class of the man.”"

More than 200 sheep have plunged to their deaths in the Pyrenees while apparently trying to escape a brown bear. The bears have been reintroduced to the mountain region over the past three decades after being wiped out by hunters.The sheep, which belonged to a farmer in Couflens, south-west France, are thought to have taken fright when the bear appeared in the area last Sunday.After the predator attacked one of the sheep, 209 others in the flock panicked and hurled themselves off a 200 metre-high cliff on the border between France and Spain. The bodies of 169 sheep were found the next day at the foot of the cliff in the Spanish village of Lladorre. The other dead animals were found in France.The Spanish news agency Europa Press said bear fur had been found on one of the dead sheep and would be analysed to try to establish exactly what had happened.Although the French government will compensate the farmer for his loss, the incident has provoked an angry response from the local branch of the French farmers’ federation.“Pastoralism – which protects biodiversity and keeps the mountains alive – is not compatible with the reintroduction of large predators,” said the Confédération Paysanne de l’Ariège.The last female brown bear native to the Pyrenees was shot dead by hunters in 2004. The French government has been engaged in a repopulation programme since the early 1990s, using bears from Slovenia. There are now thought to be about 30 brown bears in the region.More than 130 sheep died in a similar, bear-related incident in the French Pyrenees last year.Farmers on both sides of the border blame the bears for attacks on their livestock and the predators are sometimes killed. In September last year, the corpse of a brown bear – a protected species in Spain – was found with a gunshot wound to the chest in the northern regions of Asturias."

110,"Gay men in England will be allowed to donate blood three months after having sex instead of a year, under equalities reforms announced by the government. The reforms will come into force in early 2018. Notably, a lifetime ban had been imposed on gay and bisexual men donating blood across the UK during the 1980s AIDS crisis.","Medical advances mean time limit will be reduced from 12 months under plans for NHS in England

Blood donation restrictions for gay men and sex workers are to be relaxed in England and Scotland under a series of equalities reforms announced by the government. Gay men will be allowed to donate blood three months after sexual intercourse instead of a year. Sex workers, who were previously banned from donating, will be subject to the same three-month rule.Advances in testing for blood-borne viruses, including hepatitis B and C and HIV, prompted the advisory committee on the safety of blood, tissues and organs to recommend the reforms to the government, which ministers accepted.Fears over infections being passed on through donations from gay men led to an outright ban at the height of the Aids epidemic, but that was cut to 12 months in 2011. The rule changes on blood donations will be implemented from November in Scotland, and early 2018 in England.Transgender people will also be able to choose their legal sex more easily as part of the equalities reforms announced by Justine Greening. “This government is committed to building an inclusive society that works for everyone, no matter what their gender or sexuality, and today we’re taking the next step forward,” the education and equalities secretary said.“We will build on the significant progress we have made over the past 50 years, tackling some of the historic prejudices that still persist in our laws and giving LGBT people a real say on the issues affecting them.”Reforms making it easier for transgender people to chose their sex legally, by removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria and speeding up the bureaucratic process, will go out to consultation in the autumn.Greening said she wanted to reduce the stigma faced by trans people, who have to provide evidence that they have been in transition for at least two years before they can apply to change their gender legally.Theresa May indicated earlier this week that she was preparing to reform the Gender Recognition Act, saying: “When it comes to rights and protections for trans people, there is still a long way to go.”The reforms have been widely welcomed by LGBT campaigners. Ethan Spibey, founder of FreedomToDonate, which campaigns against blood donation restrictions for gay and bisexual men, said: “Today’s announcement from the government marks a world-leading blood donation policy for gay and bisexual men and the other groups previously restricted. I’m so proud that the work of FreedomToDonate and our supporters will help ensure more people than ever before are allowed to safely donate blood.“I began this campaign because I wanted to repay the donor who saved my granddad’s life after a major operation, and this announcement means I’m closer than ever to doing that, with the invaluable help of our team of volunteers, and the charities and organisations FreedomToDonate represents.”Suzanna Hopwood, a member of the Stonewall trans advisory group, said: “Reform is one of the key priorities in our vision for removing the huge inequalities that trans people face in the UK. The current system is demeaning and broken. It’s vital that this reform removes the requirements for medical evidence and an intrusive interview panel, and finally allows all trans people to have their gender legally recognised through a simple administrative process. That’s what we’ll be calling for during this consultation, and I’m looking forward to seeing the law change soon after.”"
111,"A �14 billion (?1.17 lakh crore) class-action lawsuit against Mastercard, for allegedly overcharging over 4.5 crore people in Britain over a 16-year period, was blocked by a court. The tribunal found no individual could receive compensation equal to the loss actually suffered. Had it been allowed, the case would have been the largest and most complex in British legal history.","Fledgling competition tribunal refuses to allow claim relating to 16 years of alleged overcharging to proceedA £14bn class-action lawsuit against MasterCard for allegedly overcharging more than 45 million people in Britain over a 16-year period was blocked by a British court on Friday. The competition appeal tribunal (CAT), a newly empowered court that oversees Britain’s fledgling class action regime, ruled that it would not grant the necessary collective proceedings order for the case to continue to trial. Had it been allowed to proceed, the case would have been the largest and most complex in British legal history and would have tested the limits of the new Consumer Rights Act, which introduced US-style “opt-out” collective class actions for breaches of UK or European Union competition law in 2015. MasterCard welcomed the judgment, saying the claim was “completely unsuitable” to be brought under the collective action regime.A law firm, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, launched the case on behalf of adults in Britain after MasterCard lost a drawn-out appeal against a 2007 European commission decision that ruled its fees were anti-competitive. The case centred on so-called interchange fees, the charges levied by credit and debit card companies such as MasterCard on merchants’ banks, which card companies say cover the costs of operating card services, security and innovation. It alleged these fees were a significant cost for retailers and were passed on through increased prices of goods and services to all UK consumers, including those who paid in cash and not just MasterCard holders. London-based Walter Merricks, a lawyer who once led the Financial Ombudsman Service group that handles consumer disputes with banks and who is the representative named on the proposed action, said he was considering an appeal with his advisers. “The new collective action regime was introduced by the Consumer Rights Act to overcome the difficulty for consumers seeking to recover losses from competition law infringements,” he said. “I am concerned that this new regime, designed to benefit consumers, may never get off the ground.” He added that concerns cited by the tribunal, which included the difficulties in providing evidence that MasterCard fees were passed on to consumers and in precisely calculating individual losses for so many consumers, could have been overcome. The planned lawsuit had been dubbed by one lawyer the “perfect exam question” for Britain’s CAT, nominated in 2015 to oversees the country’s maiden “opt-out” class action lawsuits in antitrust cases. Under the regime, UK-based members of a defined group are automatically bound into legal action unless they opt out. Critics say such regimes encourage claims without merit. But others argue they are designed to offer a more effective and economic route to compensation for UK-based consumers and businesses that fall victim to anti-competitive conduct and saves on hefty advertising costs to rally a large group together.The high court ruled in January that MasterCard had charged interchange fees at a lawful level and without restricting competition in a similar dispute with retailers.

112,"India's biggest listed blue-chip firms are paying their top executives salaries of up to 1,200 times the median employee remunerations, disclosures by top listed firms revealed. The pay packages of senior-most personnel rose at most private firms during 2016-17. Among the major Sensex firms, Lupin saw the ratio between the Chairman remuneration and the median employee remuneration at 1,263 times."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowA huge pay gap between CEOs and other employees at Indian companies has come to the fore, with the biggest listed blue-chip firms doling out to their top executives salary packages of up to 1,200-times of their median employee remunerations.An analysis of remuneration disclosures made by top listed companies forming part of the blue-chip index Sensex -- under directions of the capital markets regulator Sebi -- shows that the pay packages of senior-most personnel such as CEOs and executive chairmen continue to remain high and rose further at most private sector firms during 2016-17.TOP EXECUTIVES' PAY REMAINS HIGH On the contrary, the median employee remuneration fell or remained almost same during the last fiscal, while the ratio of the top executives' pay to the median employee remuneration remained at astronomically high levels of hundreds-times in many cases.The public sector companies show a totally different picture with their chiefs getting salaries of just about 3-4 times of their median employee remunerations.SEBI REGULATIONS REQUIRE COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE REMUNERATIONS  While the rules do not put any restrictions on the companies regarding how much more they want to pay their top executives vis-a-vis an average employee, the Sebi regulations require most listed companies to annually disclose various remuneration ratios to help the investors know about salary practices at the firms in which they have invested.However, salaries of top executives, especially in case of those related to promoter groups, typically require the approval of the companies boards, various committees and shareholders. Besides, the companies with inadequate profits need the governments approval for any excessive salaries paid to their top executives.As per the rules, the remuneration payable to any one managing director or whole-time director or manager, cannot exceed 5 per cent of the net profit of the company. If there is more than one such director, the remuneration cannot exceed 10 per cent of the net profit to all such directors and managers taken together.INCREASE IN RATIO OF TOP EXECUTIVE PAY Among the 30 Sensex firms, at least 15 have already disclosed an increase in the ratio of top executive pay with that of the median employee remuneration for 2016-17. Nine of the Sensex firms are yet to disclose these numbers and therefore the tally may go up.Six Sensex companies have reported some decline in this ratio and these include Wipro (down from 260 times to 259 times), Infosys (283 times), Dr Reddys Lab (from 312 times to 233 times) and Hero MotoCorp (from 755 times to 731 times).The countrys most-valued firm Reliance Industries did not disclose this ratio in its latest annual report published on the website. While its chief Mukesh Ambani has capped his pay at Rs 15 crore for many years now, the ratio was high at 205 times in 2014-15.Among other major Sensex firms, TCS saw the ratio between top-paid executive pay and the median employee remuneration rise to 515 times (from 460 times in previous year), while the same for Lupin stood at 1,263-times (though down from 1,317 times) for Chairman. The ratio for the CEO at Lupin was much lower at 217-times.At Adani Ports, the ratio was down to 42 times in case of Gautam Adani (from 48 times), while the ratio was much higher at 169-times for another Whole Time Director. The same for Bajaj Auto was also high at 522 times.Among banks, the ratio was highest for HDFC Banks CEO Aditya Puri (whose pay package rose by 20 per cent to over Rs 10 crore) where it rose from 179 to 187 times. Kotak Mahindra Bank saw the ratio rise from 42 to 48, ICICI from 100 to 112- times and Axis Bank from 72-times to 78-times. At HDFC Ltd, the ratio for the CEO Keki Mistry rose from 88 times to 92 times, while the same for Chairman Deepak Parekh was much less at 17 times.Among the companies which are yet to report their latest numbers, Larsen and Toubro had disclosed a very high ratio of 1004-times for the fiscal 2005-16.At ITC, the ratio rose from 427 to 508 times in case of Y C Deveshwar, who has now given up his top executive role, but the ratio for the current executive chief was much lesser at 59 times.Deveshwars total package rose by 58 per cent to Rs 21.16 crore, including all the benefits.Other companies that saw an increase in the ratio included Bharti Airtel (to 366-times in 2016-17), Cipla (416 times), M&M (108 times), Tata Steel (94 times) and HUL (138 times).In terms of the median employee remuneration, a few companies such as Wipro and Cipla recorded a decline and there was only a marginal rise of less than 5 per cent for several others such as Bharti Airtel, M&M, Bajaj Auto, TCS and HUL.The companies with an increase of over 10 per cent for median employee remuneration were a few and included Kotak Mahindra Bank, Adani Ports, HDFC Bank, HDFC Ltd and Lupin.Dr Reddys Lab was among the very few to see a decline in the CEO pay, while it was unchanged for RIL and Adani Ports. The companies having seen a rise in the top executive pay included Wipro, TCS, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, Tata Steel, M&M, Hero Motocorp, Lupin and Bharti Airtel.The overall key management pay rose significantly for Bharti Airtel, HDFC Bank, HDFC Ltd, TCS and Asian Paints. ALSO READ:Salary cut lesser evil than layoffs in aviation space Salary in the times of demonetisation: Big test for Modi government in first week of December   Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

Boots has said it is “truly sorry” for the way it responded to a campaign calling for it to cut the price of emergency contraception and said it is looking for cheaper alternatives. The announcement, late on Friday night, came after news that the women’s parliamentary Labour party (PLP) had written to the store’s chief pharmacist to express “deep concern” about the company’s refusal to reduce the price of emergency contraception, and as calls for a boycott continue to grow. Boots had said on Thursday it would not lower the cost of the morning-after pill despite a campaign from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), a leading provider of abortion care, with its chief pharmacist, Marc Donovan, stating that the company did not want to be accused of “incentivising inappropriate use”. Campaigners said the statement was insulting and sexist, and on Friday Anna Soubry, the Conservative MP for Broxtowe – where the Boots headquarters is located – said she was also writing a letter to the company asking it to make clear its reasons for not reducing prices.Labour women join @bpas1968 in their campaign to demand @BootsUK rethink moral judgements and sheepish assertions on emergency contraceptive pic.twitter.com/y5N670TQ4IThe Labour letter, signed by the chair of the women’s parliamentary Labour party, Jess Phillips, as well as a number of prominent MPs including Harriet Harman, Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves, said: “Boots is the largest high-street pharmacy in the UK, and 90% of the population lives within 10 minutes of one of their shops. “It is therefore completely unacceptable that British women have been paying up to £30 for a pill that costs a fraction of that to produce. The high cost of emergency contraception at Boots is preventing women from accessing it when needed.”Both Tesco and Superdrug halved the price of their emergency contraceptive following the BPAS campaign, but Boots continues to charge £28.25 for Levonelle emergency contraceptive (the leading brand) and £26.75 for its own generic version. Tesco now charges £13.50 for Levonelle and Superdrug £13.49 for a generic version. In France, the tablet costs £5.50.This is why Boots refuse to reduce the price of emergency contraception. Angry? Email @BootsUK now: https://t.co/g8NW8VAHX3 #JustSayNon pic.twitter.com/ohk3GBkBJs“Boots’ justification infantalises women and places a moral judgment on them,” Phillips told the Guardian. “Their pricing is clearly for commercial gain as Tesco and Superdrug have addressed this issue with sensible pricing.“Women do not need to be disincentivised by Boots to make personal choices about their bodies. We women go to Boots for our products, not moral guidance. Public opinion is not on their side so if they are worried about complaints they are listening to the wrong voices and customers should vote with their feet.” Phillips said she did not believe Boots “would ever pass moral judgment on men’s contraceptives”. “Do they give a lecture on consent with all condom purchases?” she said.In a recent YouGov survey, the median cost suggested by women for emergency contraception was £8, and the median cost suggested by men was £5. Almost a third of women and a quarter of men, the Labour letter added, believed emergency contraception should be free of charge.“Concern about adverse criticism from pressure groups seems a very strange reason not to do the right thing,” Soubry said. “This is perfectly proper and lawful treatment. I’ve always found Boots to be an excellent business company, they employ a lot of people in my constituency, they are a valued employer and they’ve always had a strong desire to do the right thing throughout the whole of their long history. So not doing this doesn’t sit with the way Boots normally operates and the high standing it has locally. “I would hope that they would be true to their tradition of doing the right thing, and doing the right thing is not giving in to pressure from the noisiest quarters. I am asking them for what reasons they are not reducing the cost of the morning-after pill given that other companies have reduced the charge. I urge them to reduce prices in accordance with their competitors.”The MP Stella Creasy tweeted that Boots’ decision “contravenes consumer rights act given adds disproportionate charge which is not advertised”, while the writer Marian Keyes was among those condemning the company on Twitter, saying she would be “withdrawing my (considerable) custom”.This is awful @BootsUK @BootsHelp & also contravenes consumer rights act given adds disproportionate charge which is not advertised.. https://t.co/DAvDiN1hAqAnnouncing the retailer’s change of stance on Friday night, a spokesman for Boots said: “Pharmacy and care for customers are at the heart of everything we do, and as such we are truly sorry that our poor choice of words in describing our position on emergency hormonal contraception has caused offence and misunderstanding, and we sincerely apologise.” In his original response to campaigners, Donovan said that Boots considered the issue very carefully but pointed out that the morning-after pill is already available for free in community pharmacies and NHS services. Sophie Walker, leader of the Women’s Equality party, which had joined forces with BPAS to call for a boycott using the hashtag #justsaynon, said that the morning-after pill can be difficult to access for free on the NHS, with appointments at GP surgeries or family planning clinics hard to obtain at short notice. “Many women will need to buy these pills over the counter, and it is irresponsible and exploitative for retailers to charge over the odds for them ... Boots’ approach to this concern is indicative of a society that prioritises profit over women’s health and wellbeing,” Walker said.Ann Clwyd MP, co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on sexual and reproductive health, said: “Boots need to wise up. The reality is there are too many unwanted births. How come the tablets are available in France for £5.50? A case of Boots’ profit priority, I would say.”"

A US gunship has killed at least 12 Afghan policemen in a friendly fire airstrike in Helmand, according to local officials.The incident is a setback for the US-Afghan fight against the Taliban in the embattled province, and comes as the US administration and its Nato allies are preparing the deployment of several thousand additional troops to Afghanistan.Since 2001, Helmand has consistently been the deadliest province for both foreign and Afghan forces. Since the international drawdown in 2014, the Taliban has seized territory across the province, leaving the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, and the economic hub, Gereshk, as some of the only areas still in government hands. The attack occurred on Friday afternoon, when, according to local police sources, an Afghan police unit retook a checkpoint captured by the Taliban on Thursday. Due to apparent miscommunication, a US gunship bombed the police unit 30 minutes later, according to police sources.The spokesman to the provincial governor, Omar Zawak, said the number of killed and injured was not yet clear. Helmand’s police chief said 12 members of the Afghan National Security Forces died in the strike. The incident followed a week of intensified US airstrikes in Helmand. The US air campaign in Afghanistan has reached a level not seen since 2012, when there were almost 10 times as many US troops in the country.According to Bill Salvin, spokesman for the coalition forces in Afghanistan, the US has conducted more than 50 airstrikes in the province over the past five days. In June, the US surpassed the total number of aerial attacks in Afghanistan last year, with 1,634 airstrikes conducted primarily in the south – in and around Helmand – and against Islamic State groups in the east. Following Friday’s incident, the coalition forces said in a statement: “We can confirm local security personnel aligned with Afghan government forces were killed in an airstrike in Gereshk district in Helmand province late this afternoon.” “During a US supported [Afghan defence forces] operation, aerial fires resulted in the deaths of the friendly Afghan forces who were gathered in a compound… An investigation will be conducted to determine the specific circumstances that led to this incident.”The deaths in Helmand added to a particularly bloody day for the Afghan police. In the northeastern Badakhshan province, the Taliban killed at least 32 members of the local police and government-aligned uprising groups in a push to capture Tagaq district. Some of the people killed were murdered after the Taliban surrounded a house they were staying in, while the rest were shot in an ambush, said Abdullah Naji Nazari, the head of the provincial council.

A Chinese spy ship has been spotted off the coast of Queensland during a joint training exercise between Australian and US forces, the defence department has confirmed.The Type 815 Auxiliary General Intelligence (AGI) vessel was sighted during war games, known as Exercise Talisman Sabre, and defence officials told the ABC’s AM program it was a “provocative move”. A statement from the defence department confirmed that the spy ship had remained outside Australia’s territorial waters but had entered its exclusive economic zone.However, they said the ship’s presence did not interfere with the operation of Talisman Sabre.The three-week training exercise in central Queensland has involved more than 33,000 personnel from Australia, the United States, New Zealand, Japan and Canada. This week a fleet of 33 warships and submarines amassed off the coast of Rockhampton for a final exercise as the war games came to a close. “Australia respects the rights of all states to exercise freedom of navigation in international waters in accordance with international law,” the department said.But Euan Graham, from the Lowy Institute, said the presence of the Chinese ship sent “an unfriendly message”. “I personally am not aware of any publicised appearance of an AGI off the Australian coast before,” he told the ABC. “Coinciding with a joint exercise with the United States, clearly that sends quite an unfriendly message ... at the moment what we see is a double standard where China picks the areas of the law of the sea that it likes and refuses to implement those that it doesn’t.”"

Interpol has circulated a list of 173 Islamic State fighters it believes could have been trained to mount suicide attacks in Europe in revenge for the group’s military defeats in the Middle East.The global crime fighting agency’s list was drawn up by US intelligence from information captured during the assault on Isis territories in Syria and Iraq.European counter-terror networks are concerned that as the Isis “caliphate” collapses, there is an increasing risk of determined suicide bombers seeking to come to Europe, probably operating alone.There is no evidence that any of the people on the list, whose names the Guardian has obtained, have yet entered Europe, but the Interpol circulation, designed to see if EU intelligence sources have any details on the individuals, underlines the scale of the challenge facing Europe.The list, sent out by the general secretariat of Interpol on 27 May, defines the group of fighters as individuals that “may have been trained to build and position improvised explosive devices in order to cause serious deaths and injuries. It is believed that they can travel internationally, to participate in terrorist activities.”The data was originally collected by the US intelligence “through trusted channels”. The material was handed over to the FBI, which transmitted the list to Interpol for global sharing.A note appended to the Interpol list circulated in Italy explains how the terrorist database was constructed, putting together the pieces of the puzzle from hundreds of elements, mainly gathered when Isis local headquarters were captured.“The people,” the note says, “have been identified through materials found in the hiding places of Isil, the Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant.” The note adds that “it emerges that those subjects may have manifested willingness to commit a suicidal attack or martyrdom to support Islam”.The list shows the suspects’ names, the date Isis recruited them, their last likely address including the mosque at which they have been praying while away fighting, their mother’s name and any photographs.For each of the fighters, an ID was created to ensure that each member country in the Interpol network could integrate the data with local databases.Interpol has asked its national partners for any information they might have about each name on the list, and any other background personal data they have on their files, such as border crossings, previous criminal offences, biometric data, passport numbers, activity on social media and travel history.The information will then be included in Interpol’s ASF (automatic search facility) database in order to possibly put the names on a higher level watch list.US intelligence is apparently confident about the reliability of the sources used to compile the list. But western counter-terrorism forces have said they face an uphill struggle identifying potential suspects, who have access to a mountain of false documents, double identities and fake passports.Interpol stressed the list’s transmission came as part of its role circulating information between national crime-fighting agencies. “Interpol regularly sends alerts and updates to its national central bureaux (NCB) on wanted terrorists and criminals via our secure global police communications network,” a spokesman said. “It is the member country which provides the information that decides which other countries it can be shared with.“The purpose of sending these alerts and updates is to ensure that vital policing information is made available when and where it is needed, in line with a member country’s request.”A European counter-terrorism officer said one of the purposes of circulating the list around Europe was to identify those on it who might have been born and raised in European countries. In 2015 the UN considered there were 20,000 foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria, of whom 4,000 were from Europe, but there has not previously been a specific list of those fighters including those born in the Middle East who have been identified as potential suicide bombers.The speed with which Isis fighters are likely to attempt to reach Europe will depend on a range of issues including whether the group tries to set up a new base in Syria in the wake of the impending fall of Raqqa, its last major redoubt in north-west Syria. There is a growing suggestion that Isis fighters will shift south from Raqqa to the defensible territory stretching from Deir el-Zourez-Zor to Abu Kamal.The jihadi group is currently struggling to come to terms with the loss of Mosul in northern Iraq following a battle that produced some of the most brutal fighting since the end of the second world war. The parallel advance on Raqqa, the group’s other urban stronghold in the region, has been stalled partly due to the severity of the resistance being mounted against the Syrian Democratic Forces made up of an alliance of Kurds, Arabs and US Special forces. US Army Col Ryan Dillon on Friday estimated there were around 2,000 Isis militants in the city, who he said were using civilians and children as human shields. The distance between SDF forces on the eastern side of the city and on the western fronts is now just under 2km. The United Nations estimates that about 190,000 residents of Raqqa province have been displaced since April, including about 20,000 since the operation to seize the provincial capital began in early June.US diplomats this week admitted that the SDF forces, due to their ethnic make-up, will be constrained from going south of Raqqa to pursue Isis as far as Deir Azzour, saying this may be the task of the Syrian forces under Bashar al Assad, or even Iranian-backed Shia militia."

EasyJet has opened an investigation after an unaccompanied child was removed from an overbooked flight from London Gatwick.The 15-year-old was taken from his seat on flight EZY8333 to Toulouse on Thursday morning, and left alone at the departure gate. Casper Read, a schoolboy from Worthing, West Sussex, was taking only his second flight alone, to stay with relatives in France. His mother helped him check in at the airport with his bags before he went through security to the gate. Read was given a boarding pass for seat 9A but after texting his mother to tell her he was aboard, another passenger claimed his seat. With the plane overbooked, Read was told to leave the plane. He texted his mother, Stephanie Portal, who returned to the airport and found staff to help locate her son in departures. Read’s grandparents had already embarked on the two-hour round trip to Toulouse from their home to meet him.Eventually, Portal persuaded easyJet to allocate her son a seat on the final departure of the day to Toulouse, although she said the airline’s system apparently showed all four flights on Thursday were overbooked.The final flight, scheduled to depart at 6.40pm, was delayed by almost three hours, meaning Read finally arrived in Toulouse well after midnight.Portal said: “It’s crazy. They left him alone in departures. Luckily, I had still not got on board my train to London and could come back and find him. If I had not been there I don’t know what would have happened – he’d have had no money for the train back or anything.” A spokeswoman apologised “for any inconvenience caused”, adding: “EasyJet is sorry that Casper Read’s flight from London Gatwick to Toulouse was overbooked. We are investigating why he was able to board the aircraft as he should have been informed at the gate. “EasyJet has a procedure to protect unaccompanied minors but unfortunately this was not followed on this occasion and so this will also be investigated.”Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet, said: “That is really not what we would want. It’s just not our way.” She said that on average easyJet had five no-shows on every flight, but she denied that the airline had problems with overbooking, adding: “We don’t see an overbooking issue. We don’t tend to overbook in peak periods.”Airlines worldwide have come under increased scrutiny on overbooking since an incident where a passenger was forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight. David Dao suffered concussion, lost teeth and a broken nose when he refused to leave his booked seat to make way for crew, and was dragged away by airport police."

Brenda Hale has been appointed as the first female president of the UK supreme court.Lady Hale is a longstanding champion of diversity in the judiciary. She has previously said the court should be ashamed if it does not improve its record on the issue. Her appointment was announced on Friday and she will take up the role on 2 October, when she will be sworn in as president. She said: “It is a great honour and a challenge to be appointed to succeed Lord Neuberger. I look forward to building upon his pioneering achievements, including developing closer links with each part of the United Kingdom, for example by sitting outside London, and improving the ways in which we communicate our work to the public. “Recent high-profile cases mean that more people than ever before have heard of the supreme court, and we hope that this will help to create a broader understanding of how the judiciary serves society.”Hale’s appointment was announced alongside that of Jill Black, who, after promotion from the court of appeal, becomes the second female justice in the UK’s highest court. Two other court of appeal judges, David Lloyd Jones and Michael Briggs, were also appointed to the supreme court on Friday.A family law expert, Hale joined the supreme court in 2009 and is among the last of the judges who can serve to 75 as she became a judge before rules were changed in 1995 to make retiring at 70 mandatory.She will earn £225,000 a year as the head of the court. Neuberger said: “I have had the pleasure of working closely with Lady Hale over the last five years, and have seen at first hand the intellect and humanity with which she approaches the appeals which come before her, as well as her commitment to the rule of law, legal education and building public understanding of the work of the courts.“For Lady Hale to become president of the institution to which she has contributed so much is a fitting pinnacle to a truly ground-breaking career.”Hale has criticised the inbuilt bias in choosing judges, and the dependence on “soundings” from judges, as producing a judiciary that is “not only mainly male, overwhelmingly white, but also largely the product of a limited range of educational institutions and social backgrounds”.Born in Yorkshire in 1945, she went to a state school, Richmond high school for girls, and then to Girton College, Cambridge, where she read law and graduated top of her class.Hale’s career began in academia when she joined the University of Manchester law faculty as a junior lecturer. While teaching – and working in a pub – she studied for the bar exams, winning the top results for her year in the bar finals. She was also the first woman and youngest person to be appointed to the Law Commission.In 1989, she was appointed Queen’s counsel and in 1994 she became a high court judge, the first to have made her career as an academic and public servant rather than as a practising barrister.In 1999, she became the second woman to be appointed to the court of appeal; Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss was the first. Hale also became the first female law lord. In June 2013, she was appointed deputy president of the supreme court.Like Hale, Black is a family law specialist – although she initially took on a broad range of criminal and civil work at the bar – and worked in academia, having taught at then Leeds Polytechnic in the 1980s. She was raised in north Wales and studied at Durham University. Earlier this year, the 63-year-old was on a panel of appeal court judges who ruled against the government following freedom of information requests to view a former minister’s diaries. Lloyd Jones, 65, who grew up in Pontypridd, south Wales, was a “friend of the court”, offering legal advice in the hearings into whether former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet had sovereign immunity from arrest and potential extradition to Spain over alleged human rights crimes.Briggs, 62, grew up in a naval family, following his father between ships on the south coast. While at the high court, he was in charge of the extensive Lehman Brothers insolvency litigation from 2009 to 2013."
123,"Students over-staying and not completing their course work caused the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) a loss of nearly ?12 crore, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said on Friday. The loss was caused by 212 students who continued to stay in hostels without paying the hostel fees after failing to complete the course."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowStudents overstaying and non completing their film courses at the Film and Television Institute of India have resulted in losses to the tune of up to Rs 11.83 crore, the Comptroller and Auditor General said today in a report.The massive revenue loss was caused by 212 students who failed to complete their course work, resulting in them staying on in hostels beyond the schedule completion of their academic terms.According to the CAG report, the failure of the students to complete their respective courses within the prescribed time period also resulted in admissions being held up during the academic years of 2010-11, 2014-15 and 2015-16.The 212 students continued to be on the academic roll and in hotels without any paying any fees/hostel charges, resulting in a revenue loss of Rs 11.83 crore.The CAG also said that it found cases of irregular payment of service tax, excess release of advance payment and unfruitful expenditure on consultancy fees without any commensurate benefits.STUDENTS OVERSTAYEDBetween 2006 and 2012, 315 students were admitted on a total capacity of 352 seats for various six-month diploma courses.Of these, 212 students were still on the academic roll as of March 31, 2016, as they failed to compelte their academic exercises, projects and other course work. These included 94 students who were on the roll for more than three years after their courses should have been completed.WHAT THE CAG FOUND1. The institution (FTII) neither has any specific rule to extend the tenure of such students nor any approval for such group extensions were taken from the Academic Council or Governing Council.2. The tution and hostel fees are not charged after the scheduled completion of courses. Hence, the students continued to be on academic roll and in hostels without payment of fees/hostel charges beyond the prescribed tenure of their courses.3. Continuance of a very large number of enrolled students creates additional pressure on the academic and other infrastructure of the institute.4. Of the total revenue loss of Rs 11.83 crore, Rs 2.78 crore due to FTII not charging fees for the extended duration of the courses and Rs 9.05 crore due to non-recovery of hostel fees for overstay.FTII's REPLY Responding to the CAG's findings, the FTII, in a reply on September 2016, admitted that there was a problem of students not completing their course work on time and that the institution does not have a set system of dealing with such situations.The CAG report, however, noted that the FTII students' hand book states that a student has to leave the hostel room and campus after completion of the academic tenure of his/her course.CASCADING EFFECTApart from causing a revenue loss, students overstaying at FTII has also had a cascading effect on fresh admissions, the CAG said. The situation caused the institution to skip fresh admissions in 2010, 2014, 2015.""Forgoing the admission process in an academic year defeated the purpose of setting up such a premier film and television institute and had incurred a potential revenue loss upto Rs 4.57 crore,"" the report said.ALSO READ | Food served by Indian Railways not fit for human consumption: CAGALSO READ | Textile industry has suffered loss of Rs 40,000 crore due to protests against GST, claim traders   Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

A stretch of coral reef off Mexico is the testing ground for a new idea that could protect fragile environments around the world: insurance.The reef, off the coast of Cancún, is the first to be protected under an insurance scheme by which the premiums will be paid by local hotels and government, and money to pay for the repair of the reef will be released if a storm strikes.Coral reefs offer a valuable buffer against storm damage from waves but their condition has deteriorated in recent years, the result of human exploitation and destruction of the reefs, as well as climate change, plastic waste and the acidification of the oceans.Under the Cancún insurance policy, pioneered by the insurance company Swiss Re and the Nature Conservancy, a US environmental charity, local organisations dependent on tourism will pay in to a collective pot likely to amount to between $1m (£770,000) and $7.5m for the insurance premiums on the policy, and a 40 mile (60km) stretch of reef and connected beach will be monitored. If any destructive storms damage the reef system, the insurer will pay out sums likely to be $25m to $70m in any given year.Any payouts will be used for restoration of the reef, for instance by building artificial structures that can increase the height of the reef in case of storm damage.Corals from the reef can be removed and rested for a period of weeks or months, to help them regrow, at which point they can be safely reattached to their native habitat to regenerate the growth of the reef system. The advantages of such restoration go far beyond the hotels that border the seafront. As well as providing a natural brake against destructive storms, coral reefs provide nurseries for fish when they are growing, and form a vital part of the marine ecosystem. Their health or decline is seen as one of the key indicators of the state of the natural environment globally.The Cancún scheme, which is to be run by Swiss Re and the Nature Conservancy, with backing from the Mexican government, is thought to be one of the first in the world to tie environmental benefits and the “eco-system services” provided by natural environmental features to firm monetary costs and rewards. It could provide a model for similar projects in the future, linking the protection and preservation of the environment to payouts in case of disaster.Hotels and private companies are signing up to the scheme at present, and the plan is for a fund backed by the government that will cover the premiums. This is scheduled to be activated in September, with further contracts to be signed in November and December, and full coverage will then begin from next January.“Public-private partnerships are the key,” said Mark Tercek, chief executive of the Nature Conservancy, in an interview with the Guardian. He predicted that more governments would see the advantages of such an approach when the Cancún scheme begins formal operation.“I used to get very frustrated that not enough was happening [to protect the environment],” said Tercek. “We have to push business leaders to go further, to stick their neck out to tackle issues beyond the short term.”Tercek said the Cancún scheme would provide an example for businesses, governments and insurance firms that would be “very scalable around the world”.A future target for similar insurance products could be mangrove swamps, which also protect the shore against storm damage, and are equally under threat, with many destroyed to make way for housing development or farming, and others in peril from climate change."

Simpson’s attorney, Malcolm LaVergne, has ended questioning. That will end our live coverage. To summarize: A Nevada parole board has voted unanimously to allow OJ Simpson to go free as early as October, citing the former NFL star’s compliance with prison rules, his lack of prior convictions, his low risk of committing another crime, his community support and stable post-release plans. Thanks for following along with us and be sure to read Amanda Holpuch’s full report on today’s hearing below.

15:19

Simpson’s attorney said he never believed parole was a sure thing: “It was hard to know the certainty of this,” LaVergne says. “Mr Simpson is obviously a very polarizing figure. He’s very well loved, but he’s also held into contempt by a lot of people.” 

3.15pm EDT
15:15

LaVergne now berating a reporter who’s brought up retired correctional officer Jeffrey Felix who worked at Lovelock and talked about Simpson. The attorney says he’s started the process of getting Felix’s pension stipped. Interestingly, when Simpson was sitting in front of a hot mic in the moments before the parole board’s decision was announced, the microphone overheard him saying he might sue Felix.

3.11pm EDT
15:11

It’s official: Inmate No. 1027820 at Lovelock correctional facility will be released in October. Now Simpson’s attorney Malcolm LaVergne is fielding questions from media. LaVergne says Fremong’s testimony in favor of Simpson was very helpful in helping broker Simpson’s release. Right now Fremong is sitting with Simpson and his family inside the facility, he says. “They’re friends,” LaVergne says. “This was a big mishap.”

2.55pm EDT
14:55

Now the parole board is back in the room, saving OJ from the hot mic (and himself). Tony Corda is speaking. He says Simpson deserved to go to prison for his crime, but he’s complied with the rules of the prison, he’s a low risk to reoffend, he has community support and stable post-release plans. The question is whether he’s served enough time in prison on this case. Corda agrees he has.Jackson and Endel also concur. And finally Bisbee votes to grant parole, completing the unanimous 4-0 decision.BREAKING: O.J.

OJ Simpson and his attorney Malcolm LaVergne are back in the teleconference room at Lovelock correctional center. Now Simpson is smiling and laughing with others in the room on a hot mic (!), talking about the challenges of the teleconference format.

2.34pm EDT
14:34

If there was any surprise to today’s routine hearing, it was Simpson’s semi-confrontational posture to the board, specifically the self-justification of the robbery in his opening remarks. That said, every testimony was in his favor and by all accounts he’s shown himself to be rehabilitated: a model prisoner. Most seem to agree he’s served more than enough time for the crime he’s been incarcerated for. All signs indicate he will be paroled today and released on or around 1 October, but it’s not as if Simpson’s very American tale hasn’t offered up final-reel twists in the past. Stay tuned.

2.19pm EDT
14:19

Bisbee calls the hearing into recess so the board can move into deliberations, which could take up to a half hour. The four-member panel must be unanimous to make a decision. If they are divided, the other two commissioners are brought in to add their feedback. From there, it’s subject to a simple majority. A 3-3 deadlock will result in another hearing in six months’ time.Updated

Fromong closes: “We all make mistakes. OJ made his. He’s been here and from what I’ve heard he’s been a model inmate. He’s been an example to others. During the trial I recommended he serve one to three years. That’s what I recommended to the DA. I’m here to say that I’ve known OJ for a long time. I don’t feel he’s a threat to anyone out there. “He’s a good man. I know that he does a lot for other people and I feel that nine-and-a-half-to-33 years was way too long. And I feel that it’s time to give him a second chance. It’s time for him to go home to his family, his friends. This is a good man, he made a mistake.”

2.14pm EDT
14:14

Now Bruce Fromong is speaking. He says first and forement he’s not only here as Simpson’s friend of almost 27 years, but he’s also appearing as a victim of a crime. He believes Simpson was misguided on the date of the crime, that he was misled about what was going to be there that day. He was promised family photos, family heirlooms, possibly his ex-wife’s engagement ring, when in reality it was mostly football memorabilia. He admits there were items in that room that were stolen from Simpson, but he insists that he never stole anything from OJ. (A point on which Simpson appears to agree.)“I will make this clear to you: OJ never held a gun on me,” Fromong says. “There was a coward in that room, a man named McClinton, who came up gangster-style. He held the gun on me. Not OJ. Another man came in, hit me. Not OJ, he never laid a hand on me.”

2.07pm EDT

Simpson’s attorney’s second point focuses on the amends that Simpson has made with Bruce Fromong, one of the two robbery victims (and the only one still living). Fromong will testify next, but Simpson will make his closing statement first.“I am sorry the things turned out the way they did,” Simpson says in his final statement to the board. “I had no intention to commit a crime.”

LaVergne says this letter, which he claims he’s reading without Simpson’s knowledge, proves Simpson’s positive intentions and represents “the definiton of character”: that Simpson had a friend suddenly in a position of power but he refused to use it to try and get better treatment or an early release. That’s the first part of LaVergne’s closing remarks, he says.

Endel asks how he’d anticipate dealing with public scrutiny if released. Simpson says he’s been recognized publicly “since I was 19” and is more than used to it. He says even in the two decades since his double-murder trial, he rarely encounteres negativity on the streets and has remained as appraochable as ever.

Adam Endel, another parole commissioner, asks whether he’s completed his restitution payments to the victims. After a bit of a confusion, Simpson confirms he has. Endel then asks why parole would be better for Simpson than completing his sentence in Lovelock. Simpson says he’s been denied time with his four kids long enough: “I’ve served my time. ... I’ve not complained for nine years. All I’ve done is try to be helpful.”He says he’s received many interview requests and job offers from media and turned them all down. Endel asks if Simpson emphasizes that any violation of his parole, if it’s granted, would result in his returning to prison: “I’ve never lived a criminal life. I’m a pretty straight shooter.”

“I haven’t made any excuses in nine years here,” Simpson says. “But I should have never let these security guys try to help when they were only trying to help themselves.”Jackson says they’ve received hundreds of letters of support and hundreds of letters against his release. Most of the latter group, Jackson says, have begged the board to consider Simpson’s criminial trial in the 1994 murders of his ex-wife and her friend and subsequent civil judgment against Simpson. Jackson confirms what we already knew: the board will not considered either of these factors in their decision. Simpson somewhat meekly shrugs his shoulders in consent.

Corn asks another question: “What do you think the impact was on your victims?” Simpson says he knows what the impact was, but re-emphasizes that no one ever accused him of pulling a weapon on them.Now Susan Jackson, another parole commissioner, asks about his commitment to Christianity and how he started a Baptist ministy in prison. He then tells Jackson about the various courses he’s complete in prison, inclduing courses in Alternative to Violence and Victim Empathy. He admits that he “had a few drinks” on the day of the robbery because they were celebrating a wedding, but he never had a substance abuse issue. Jackson says that she asks the question because he promised the parole board in 2013 that he’d attend Alcoholics Anonymous, which he hasn’t done. Simpson says he never had a problem and believed that his initiative with the Baptist prayer group and role as commissioner of an 18-team softball league compensates for the exprience he’d have had in AA.

... Simpson’s voice raises as he goes deeper into his account: “It’s been ruled legally by the state of California that the property was mine.” He finds it unfair that he’s in jall for going to retrieve property that courts ultimately found was rightfully his. He says he didn’t realize guns were brandished in the hotel room until after they were back in the car driving back to their hotel.

The former NFL star explains he was contacted by a man who offered photographs of the sports memorabilia that OJ immediately recognized as personal belongings, including his mother’s photo album and personal letters. By chance, “a perfect storm” as Simpson called it, they all ended up in Las Vegas at the same time. The people who had the memorabilia were former friends of OJ, he explains, who had actually helped him move the stuff into storage before. He continues to tell how the scheme to retrieve the property unfolded, nothing that’s not already in the public record. He emphasizes that he had no weapon. (Remember: The four other men who accompanied Simpson, including two who testified that they carried guns, accepted plea deals in the heist and received probation.)He continues ...

Simpson is asked whether the first time he was arrested was after the age of 24. He admits he was arrested for the first time “when I was 46 or 47”. We all know what that was for.Bisbee says he’s had a substance abuse issue and that Simpson is male. Then she says that Simpson is “90 years old” and both rooms erupt in laugher. OJ, of course, is 70. She corrects her error with a smile. He has stable post-release plans and no gang affiliations.Bisbee says these factors make Simpson a low risk, but the violent nature of the offense will force the board consider factors, both aggravating and mitigating.

“Mr Simpson, you are getting the same hearing that everybody else gets,” Bisbee says, prompting a hint of laughter from Simpson and his attorney, but adds that she will be adding more information than necessary due to the excessive amount of media interest in the case. Bisbee goes into the explaining the detailed risk assessment used by Nevada to determine the prisoner’s likelihood of committing another crime: “It’s pretty darn predictive is the bottom line here.”

The board will depend heavily on a points system that considers 11 factors, including criminal history, age and gender, history of alcohol and/or drug abuse, and behavior as an inmate. Most of these are expected to align in Simpson’s favor. Remember: the same four commissioners for todays hearing already granted Simpson parole on the lesser charges of kidnapping, robbery and burglary in a July 2013 hearing.One factor that won’t be considered is Simpson’s trial (and ultimate acquittal) in the 1994 killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman.

OJ Simpson, a/k/a inmate No1027820, is scheduled to appear before the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners today for a hearing that will determine whether one of America’s most notorious prisoners will be released after serving nine years of a 33-year sentence for convictions related to a 2007 kidnapping and armed robbery at a Las Vegas hotel.The hearing is slated to begin at 10pm local time (1pm ET/6pm BST) or just about 25 minutes from now. Here’s a general idea of what to expect:The release of Simpson, now 70, would no doubt kick off a renewed media frenzy that’s been suggested in the days leading up to today’s hearing, which will be broadcast live nationally on ESPN.

The disgraced gridiron hero, with the help of several other accomplices, broke into a Las Vegas hotel room on 13 September 2007 and held up two memorabilia dealers for collectibles and personal items he claimed were rightfully his. He was found guilty by a jury on all 12 charges and given the maximum sentence.Four members from the Nevada board of parole commissioners will consider parole for Simpson at the board offices in Carson City in a hearing scheduled for 10am PT. Simpson will participate by video conference from about 100 miles away at Lovelock correctional center, the Pershing County prison where he has been incarcerated since December 2008.The same four commissioners already granted Simpson parole on the lesser charges of kidnapping, robbery and burglary in a July 2013 hearing. That ruling left Simpson with four years remaining before reaching the minimum sentence of nine years.The rate of inmates who are granted parole in discretionary hearings held as they approach their minimum sentence is around 82%."

A Saudi prince has been arrested after a video emerged online purporting to show him abusing someone and pointing a rifle at another.King Salman ordered the arrest and interrogation of the prince on Wednesday, a day after short clips were published on YouTube and shared on Twitter showing what appears to be a rifle pointed towards a man bleeding from the head and pleading.One video, viewed more than 760,000 times, shows 18 bottles of Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky on a table and a wad of cash. The sale and consumption of alcohol in Saudi Arabia is forbidden.Another shows a man sitting in a car, bleeding and being cursed at for parking in front of a house, while a further clip shows what appears to be the prince punching and slapping a man sitting on a chair.The clips went viral in Saudi Arabia under an Arabic Twitter hashtag that said “prince transgresses on citizens”.أمير سعودي يعتدي على مواطنيين ويهينهم.اتمنى ان يصل الهاشتاق ترند لكي يعرف العالم العبودية التي يعيشها الشعب .#امير_يعتدي_على_مواطنين pic.twitter.com/ImCsxwOtJeSaudi Arabia’s state TV reported on Wednesday that the king ordered a full investigation into the incidents and the arrest of Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Musaed bin Saud bin Abdulaziz, as well as any associates who appeared in the clips. He ordered that no individual involved in the case be released until a court had issued a ruling in line with the country’s sharia laws.In the order, King Salman urged people to remain vigilant in monitoring any exploitation of status or abuse of power.After he issued the order, a video seen nearly 250,000 times showed the young, low-level prince, dressed in a black T-shirt and grey jogging bottoms, handcuffed and with his feet chained, being escorted into a building by security officers.While many Saudis wrote in support of the king’s decision on Twitter, the outspoken rights activist Moudi Aljohani said the order pointed to how lax the authorities were when it came to royals.The arrest comes a day after state media reported that a woman filmed walking around a historic Saudi fort in a miniskirt and crop top sparked outrage among conservatives for defying the kingdom’s dress code for women, which requires females in public to cover themselves in long, loose robes. The outcry prompted police to detain and question her for several hours before she was released without charge.While Saudi royals are given privileged status in the kingdom, in addition to undisclosed monthly allowances from the state, they are not immune to prosecution. In an extremely rare event, the kingdom executed a prince last October who had fatally shot another man. Saudi Arabia has one of the highest rates of executions in the world.Since ascending to the throne in 2015, King Salman has branded himself a “decisive” leader. He has fired ministers caught on video being rude or insulting citizens. He also fired a senior royal court official who was filmed slapping a photographer.Before becoming king, Salman served as the governor of the capital, Riyadh, and as defence minister. A leaked 2007 US embassy memo said he “is often the referee in family disputes”. He also reportedly oversaw a prison for wayward royals in Riyadh."

Chinese authorities claim Liu Xia is a free woman. But one week after the death of her husband, the Nobel laureate and democracy activist Liu Xiaobo, a visit to the couple’s Beijing home immediately gives the lie to that claim.Within seconds of arriving at the tree-lined property on Wednesday, the Guardian was surrounded by plain-clothes security agents, shouting orders and questions, demanding that its reporters leave.“Where are you going? Where are you going?” snapped one man, wearing black Bermuda shorts and Adidas Superstars, as he used his body to block the path that leads to the fourth-floor flat. A second agent arrived, also clad in black, and then a third, brandishing a golden Chinese smartphone with which he threatened to call the police. Asked if Liu Xia was at home he said: “I have never heard of her.”He went on: “There are thousands of people living here with that name. How should I know which one you are talking about?”In the lead-up to the death of her jailed husband, Liu Xia had been forced to endure almost seven years of unofficial house arrest – Communist party retribution, observers say, for her husband’s 2010 Nobel peace prize.Now, with Liu gone, the 56-year-old artist and poet appears to have been thrust straight back into that invisible prison.Rumours have swirled that Liu – last seen in propaganda photographs of her husband’s cremation and sea burial on Saturday – had been forcibly “travelled” to the southwestern province of Yunnan to prevent her speaking out.On Thursday, however, supporters admitted her whereabouts were a mystery.“She’s totally incommunicado,” said Jared Genser, a US human rights lawyer who has campaigned on behalf of the late dissident and his wife. “It seems like she has fallen off the face of the Earth.”Hu Jia, a Beijing-based activist and friend, also said he was in the dark: “We’ve tried every means possible to contact her.”In the hours after the death of Liu, who was serving an 11-year prison sentence for subversion when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer in late May, there were calls from activists and western governments for Liu Xia to be given safe passage out of China.“I now urge [Beijing] to lift all restrictions on his widow, Liu Xia,” the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said in a statement.China, however, has shown no sign of backing down, instead insisting, contrary to the evidence, that Liu Xia – who has never been accused or convicted of any crime – is “free”.Friends and supporters say that is a mendacious fabrication designed to conceal her continued extra-legal incarceration. “I think she’s in an even worse position than before,” said Genser.“Her husband is dead. We are not aware that she has any contact with anybody at all. Her parents have both passed away. Her brother is also incommunicado and disappeared. And she is the only person now who can speak to what she heard from Liu Xiaobo in the last seven years of her being under house arrest and in his final weeks of life.”Jerry Cohen, an expert in Chinese law and human rights from New York University, said he believed the rulers of one-party China would be reluctant to release Liu Xia in case she became a figurehead of resistance.“The wife who has to suffer for the political views of her husband has always been a figure to attract sympathy. But she is much more,” he said. “She is an extraordinarily able and determined person and they feel they shouldn’t allow her to speak … She is too potent a symbol.”On Wednesday it was impossible to know whether that symbol was inside her apartment, outside of which security agents lurked in a black SUV.Plain-clothes agents guarding the leafy residential compound grew increasingly jittery and aggressive as they tried to force journalists away from the property. “You should get out!” growled one of the officers, losing his temper at repeated questions about the dissident’s missing wife.“Go! Go! Go!” shouted his colleague.Earlier in the week journalists from the Spanish news agency EFE reported being grabbed and threatened by unidentified men and held by police after trying to visit Liu Xia’s home. Police reportedly accused the journalists of working in an “illegal manner”. Genser said Liu Xia’s disappearance meant world leaders such as Donald Trump, Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Theresa May had no choice but to challenge Chinese president Xi Jinping. “This is enough: this is enough punishment to heap on the back of one woman for having done nothing other than marry her own husband.”Genser warned that a failure to speak up now would signal to Beijing that it was “open season” on Chinese human rights activists.“Xi Jinping has squeezed so incredibly hard and with no pushback from the international community. The message that is sent to the Chinese is: ‘Just do whatever you like. The world will look the other way’.”Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"

The United States has ended a four-month ban on passengers carrying laptops onboard US-bound flights from certain airports in the Middle East and North Africa, bringing to an end one of the controversial travel restrictions imposed by President Donald Trump’s administration. Riyadh’s King Khalid international airport was the last of 10 airports to be exempted from the ban, the US department of homeland security (DHS) confirmed in a tweet late on Wednesday local time.With enhanced security measures in place, all restrictions on large PEDs announced in March for 10 airports/9 airlines have been lifted. Middle East carriers have blamed Trump’s travel restrictions, which include banning citizens of some Muslim-majority countries from visiting the United States, for a downturn in demand on US routes. In March, the United States banned large electronics in cabins on flights from 10 airports in the Middle East and North Africa over concerns that explosives could be concealed in the devices taken onboard aircraft. The ban has been lifted on the nine airlines affected – Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Royal Jordanian , Kuwait Airways, EgyptAir and Royal Air Maroc – which are the only carriers to fly direct to the US from the region. A ban on citizens of six Muslim-majority countries – Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, – remains in place, though has been limited after several US court hearings challenged the restrictions. “The aviation industry has been trying to come together with a united message to governments and stakeholders about regulation and supporting the industry,” said Will Horton, senior analyst at Australian aviation consultancy CAPA. “That was dealt a first blow from the travel ban and then a second from the large electronics ban.“ Leading industry group the International Air Transport Association (IATA) criticised the laptop ban as ineffective, as security experts argued that militants could travel to the US via Europe or elsewhere where the restrictions did not apply. US officials lifted the ban after visiting the 10 airports in Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey over the past three weeks to confirm new security measures announced last month were being implemented. On Thursday, the US issued a revised directive to airlines around the world in response to requests that it clarify aviation security measures scheduled to start taking effect this week. The new requirements include enhanced passenger screening at foreign airports, increased security protocols around aircraft and in passenger areas and expanded canine screening. They affect 325,000 airline passengers on about 2,000 commercial flights arriving daily in the US, on 180 airlines from 280 airports in 105 countries. Airlines that fail to meet the new security requirements could face in-cabin electronics restrictions. The United Kingdom continues to enforce a similar in-cabin ban on electronics ban on flights from some Middle Eastern airports. Those restrictions apply to flights from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia."

After almost 11 hours of surgery involving four teams of doctors, Zion Harvey had earned his place in medical history. The eight-year-old had become the first child in the world to receive two new hands in a procedure that seemed to herald a revolution in transplant medicine.Two years on, the sports-mad boy from Baltimore, Maryland, is enjoying the freedom and independence his new hands have given him. In the first medical journal report of Zion’s pioneering treatment, published on Wednesday, the experts involved declare the operation a success and say other children could benefit from the knowledge gained.Zion had to rely on others after he had his hands and feet amputated aged two when he contracted sepsis. For six years he used a combination of his residual limbs and specialist equipment to dress, wash himself and eat – until the double transplant changed his life. “At 18 months [after the transplant], the child had exceeded his previous adaptive abilities. As of 18 months after transplantation surgery he is able to write and feed, toilet and dress himself more independently and efficiently than he could do before transplantation,” writes the team from the Children’s hospital of Philadelphia in the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health.Organ transplantation is risky in that a recipient’s body may reject the new body part, while the drug regime involved carries a series of health risks. Two years on from the surgery he had in July 2015, Zion, now 10, is coping well with both. “Cases like this demonstrate how new developments and innovation in science and transplantation have the potential to make enormous differences to the quality of life of patients,” said Lorna Marson, the president of the British Transplantation Society, which represents specialists working in the field across the NHS. “Transplantation is a constantly evolving sector and it is heartening to hear the positive outcomes of groundbreaking transplants such as this one.”More than 100 people worldwide have had a hand or arm transplant since the first adult received a new hand in 1998, closely followed by the first replacement of both hands in 2000. Many countries now conduct such transplants on small numbers of carefully selected patients. In May 2000, a baby girl in Malaysia who was born with a severe congenital deformity became the first child to receive a new hand and arm, transplanted from her identical twin sister who died at birth. In an update last year on his progress in the year since his surgery, Zion said: “The only thing that’s different is instead of no hands, I have two hands. I’m still the same kid everybody knew without hands.” Referring to his new hands, he added: “Here’s the piece of my life that was missing. Now it’s here, my life is complete.” Within eight months of the operation Zion was using scissors and crayons and after a year he was able to swing a baseball bat with both hands – once throwing the opening pitch at a Baltimore Orioles game. Dr Scott Levin, team leader for Zion’s 10-hour surgery, has praised his young patient’s bravery. “I’ve never seen Zion cry. I’ve never seen him not want to do his therapy. He’s just such a remarkable human being, let alone child or adult. He has such courage and determination and gives us all inspiration,” he said.But the last two years have been mentally and physically hard for Zion. He has had huge amounts of physiotherapy and occupational therapy to help him adjust, as well as counselling to aid his psychological recovery. The doctors write: “Since his surgery he has undergone eight rejections of the hands, including serious episodes during the fourth and seventh months of his transplant. All of these were reversed with immunosuppression drugs without impacting the function of the child’s hands.” He is still taking four different immunosuppressant drugs to maximise the chances of his body continuing to tolerate the pair of new hands, though doctors hope to reduce the dose. “While functional outcomes are positive and the boy is benefitting from his transplant, this surgery has been very demanding for this child and his family,” said Dr Sandra Amaral, a member of the team at the Philadelphia hospital. However, in an accompanying comment article, Dr Marco Lanzetta, an Italian expert in hand transplant surgery, doubts that many children could tolerate a similar procedure and highlights the risks from lifelong use of immunosuppressants. Zion’s case was exceptional as he was already on the drugs, after receiving a kidney from his mother, Pattie Ray. Prosthetic hands and limbs, adds Lanzetta, have now developed so much that they, rather than transplant surgery, are more likely to prove the future for patients like Zion."

It’s happened again. A public vote to name four trains running between the Swedish cities of Stockholm and Gothenburg has resulted in one of the four being called Trainy McTrainface in an echo of the name chosen by the British public for the new polar research vessel.Trainy McTrainface received 49% of the votes in a poll, jointly run by Swedish rail company MTR Express and Swedish newspaper Metro.That placed it well ahead the other three options: Hakan, Miriam and Poseidon.The other trains have already been named by the public: one is named Estelle, after the five-year-old daughter of Sweden’s Princess Victoria, the next in line to the Swedish throne.Another is named Glenn, after a long-running joke that everyone in Gothenburg is called Glenn. The joke has a basis in fact: the name is particularly common in the city and its surrounding area, with its popularity stemming from the 1980s, when local football team IFK Göteborg had four players all called Glenn in its lineup. Forty-three per cent of voters supported the name Glenn.The fourth train has yet to be named. A fifth train, Ingvar, after the Swedish TV personality Ingvar Oldsberg, was named before voting began.The public vote was eventually overruled in the case of Boaty McBoatface and the ship named the RRS Sir David Attenborough, with an onboard submersible receiving the Boatface appellation.MTR Express said the McBoatface decision had led to disappointment worldwide and it hoped the name Trainy McTrainface would “be received with joy by many, not only in Sweden”.The RRS Sir David Attenborough sets sail at last"

Hundreds of gang members in New Zealand are preparing for the inaugural “fight club” – an organised boxing match between rival gangs that leaders hope will present a safe way to vent simmering tensions.Some 60 rival gang members from some of New Zealand’s most notorious chapters – including Black Power, Head Hunters and Nomads – will face off at a Whangarei community centre on Saturday night. It is the fourth choice of venue after three other options pulled out of the controversial event. Former gang member and event organiser Tokomauri Hoterene said a spate of gang killings in Northland on the North Island in 2016 had brought gang tensions in his region to new highs. There are ten different gangs in Northland and Hoterene said 80% of the violence is related to disputes over drugs. Hoterene and his fellow organisers hope some of the lingering anger can be punched out in the boxing ring, but its been a challenge to get venues and some members of the community on board. “As soon as anybody hear’s gang – boom – shuts down. We went through three venues till we actually found one ... we are looking at doing this properly, it has to be controlled because we want this to continue,” Hoterene told Maori Television.  “I’d rather walk out of a ring with a broken nose and a black eye and maybe some more missing teeth than I would coming home in a box” The president of the New Zealand chapter of the Mongrel Mob known as Smashdog told Maori Television it was about time gangs started addressing their differences. “We should be sticking together you know, brothers aye, that’s what we’re all about, sticking together,” he said.  “Things have changed. We’re trying to make good all the P [methamphetamine] and all that sort of stuff and all the murders. We’ve just had enough.”Whangarei Police said in a statement they were aware of fight night and there would be an increased police presence in the area. Maori wardens will also be there.“Police will conduct checks of those attending, and traveling to and from the event,” the statement said."

Russia’s state consumer watchdog has warned that fidget spinners could be harmfully addictive, after state TV said the toys could make people susceptible to the messages of the political opposition.The watchdog said it had noted “the aggressive promotion of so-called spinners around children and teenagers” and was aware of concern from parents and teachers.It said it would ask scientists to “study the effects of the influence of spinners on children’s health, including possible negative consequences”.The announcement, accompanied by warnings not to buy spinners on the street and to check them for chemical smells, came after fearmongering over the toys on state television.A show called Virus on Rossiya 24 television on 12 July called spinners an “instrument for zombifying” and a “form of hypnosis”.Spinners “often have a negative effect on the psyche and make a person susceptible to manipulation”, the presenter warned.“Possibly it is not by chance that they have started selling spinners” at opposition rallies, he added.The Life News pro-Kremlin news site on Tuesday ran a feature on “Seven tragedies that happened to children because of spinners”, including a six-year-old boy who got one stuck on his finger.The move to check spinners prompted plenty of ridicule.“How would you check this? Make 1,000 children play with 1,000 spinners for 1,000 hours and then make them write a test?” wrote the video blogger and comedian Yury Khovansky on Twitter.The toys first became popular in the US this spring before hitting Europe. They have been banned at some schools in the US, France and Britain. Donald Trump’s son Barron was photographed playing with one last month as he descended the steps of Air Force One."

Jessica Ennis-Hill will finally get her hands on the 2011 world championships gold medal originally denied her by the Russian drugs cheat Tatyana Chernova at a special ceremony at next month’s world championships in London. The news was confirmed when Chernova lost her appeal against a retrospective ban for taking steroids at the court of arbitration for sport. It means Ennis-Hill becomes a three-times world heptathlon champion, to go along with her Olympic gold and silver medals.The Guardian has also learned that the number of medallists who will be re-allocated medals at London 2017 will be significantly increased to include non-British athletes, with discussions taking place about when to hold the special ceremonies. The original plan had been to put them all on the morning of 11 August but they may now run over several days.When the news was broken to her coach Toni Minichiello, he replied: “Alle-bloody-luia. It’s excellent news – I thought the fillibustering would go on for ever. It just adds credence to my belief that she is the best female athlete Britain has ever produced.”Minichiello also welcomed the news that international athletes, too, cheated out of medals by drugs cheats would be rewarded. “That’s a fitting decision – because this is not just a British result but an international one. Maybe they should cancel one day of the athletics devote it to all the medal ceremonies they will need?”Ennis-Hill won gold medals in Berlin in 2009 and Beijing in 2015 but could finish only second in Daegu in 2011, 129 points behind Chernova. Last year, before the Russian’s appeal to CAS, Ennis-Hill posted a picture of the Russian beating her on Instagram in 2011 before writing: “This image was forever imprinted on my mind! However much it drove me on for what I was about to achieve in my first Olympics in London in my heart I just knew it was wrong. So happy to be finally receiving my gold medal. Triple world champion.

Pakistan’s supreme court has begun hearings that will decide the future of the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who is fighting for his job and contesting a damning corruption report by an investigative panel. The supreme court is expected to order Sharif be tried Sharif on corruption charges, or disqualify him, but few expect the judges to dismiss the case after the panel tabled a damaging 254-page report into his family wealth. Sharif has denied any wrongdoing after the report alleged his family’s vast wealth was beyond their means and accused his children, including presumed heir Maryam, of signing forged documents to obscure ownership of four flats in London’s Mayfair. Sharif, 67, has rejected demands by opposition parties to resign, warning his replacement would destabilise the country and imperil hard-won economic gains since his poll victory in 2013.“It hurts that despite all of our hard work, attempts are afoot once again to push the country back,” Sharif told a meeting of his ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party at the weekend.In April Sharif narrowly escaped disqualification after the supreme court ruled there was insufficient evidence to remove him – by a 2-3 split – over documents released by the Panama Papers leak into offshore wealth. But it ordered further investigations, and the formation of the joint investigation team (JIT) panel. Sharif has talked of a conspiracy against him, but has not named anyone. His allies, however, privately claim that elements of Pakistan’s powerful military and the judiciary are bent on toppling him. The army spokesman brushed aside questions about claims the military’s hidden hand was the driving force behind the JIT investigation, saying “the Pakistan army is not directly connected”. The six-person JIT panel included one member from the military intelligence agency and another from the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, the country’s top spy agency. Sharif, the son of an industrialist, is serving his third term in power and has had a fractious relationship with the army. He was originally nurtured by the military as a civilian politician who would protect their interests, and he served as prime minister twice in the 1990s. But relations soured and his second stint as prime minister ended when he was ousted in a 1999 coup leading to a decade of exile. Relations with the military during the current term have also been tense. Sharif’s legal team and the opposition will be given a chance to contest the JIT findings and Sharif is also expected to be summoned to appear before the court in coming days or weeks. Opposition politicians say Sharif is concocting claims of conspiracy to save his skin and argue that if he really wanted to protect democracy he should step down. Imran Khan, the opposition leader who pushed the hardest for Sharif to be investigated, said the prime minister would end up in jail, and vowed protests if he was not ousted by the court. “Either we will celebrate in Islamabad or otherwise we will hit the streets to save our democracy and to make sure we send this mafia to Adiyala jail,” Khan told supporters.Thousands of supporters of Imran Khan and Tahir-ul-Qadri enter Islamabad compound containing government ministries"

A bitter stand-off between a local community and miners has emerged after a significant seam of gold was found on protected conservation land in New Zealand’s North Island.Last week New Talisman Gold Mines reported they had found a large vein of gold in the Karangahake Gorge in the North Island; 8,500kg of highest quality gold which put it in the top five percent of deposits worldwide when ranked on grade, according to the company.The find is believed to be worth tens of millions of New Zealand dollars.Talisman’s general manager of operations Wayne Chowles said the company planned to begin extracting small amounts of gold early next year, but locals in opposition to the scheme have sprung into action, saying the mining project threatens the “peace and harmony” of their “sacred” mountain and community.The Karangahake Gorge lies on protected department of conservation land in the Coromandel peninsula and is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. Located one and a half hour’s drive from Auckland and 55 minutes from Hobbiton, the scenic gorge is famed for its rich history and lush natural beauty.But now the mining company and walkers are forced to share one narrow access road to the mountain.Chowles said there would be “flow-down” benefits to the local community, and the footprint of the mining company in the reserve was “small” at just 0.4 of a hectare with 95 percent of the proposed mining activity taking place underground. The company says the mine’s water supply was also processed through a “closed loop system”. “We do not believe that our activities have, or will, significantly disrupt the peace and beauty of the gorge,” said Chowles.. But some locals stridently disagree. Ruby Jane Powell is a member of the protest group Protect Karangahake. The group has been opposing any mining action in the gorge for a number of years, but have “doubled their efforts” this week to protect the land, sending dozens of protestors to block the access road, or slow down prospecting efforts by sending “very slow walkers” to clog up the road and prevent vehicle access. “We don’t want to take direct action but we are left with no choice, the government and the department of conservation have failed to protect this treasured land,” said Powell. “It is a really popular recreation area, and the local water source is taken down-stream from the mine. In general our culture and economy is really interlinked with the eco-tourism and outdoor aspect of life in the Coromandel, and mining threatens that,” said Powell. The government and the department of conservation have failed to protect this treasured landPowell said communication between the community and New Talisman had broken down. “The reality is that gold-mining makes money for a few people, but we are the ones that pay the cost, we will have to live with a degraded environment and an altered sense of peace in the mountain.”Green Party MP Catherine Delahunty said industrial scale gold mining on Karangahake mountain would “turn a beautiful recreational park and sacred mountain into an industrial zone”.“This is public land which has been set aside to protect its ecological values and for recreation. It is a sacred mountain to the indigenous people of the area and local residents are actively and peacefully opposing the initial development of the mining activity on the mountain.“The New Zealand Government is also hell bent on opening up conservation areas to mining but they do not have a mandate to destroy our precious places “New Talisman were granted a 25-year mining permit to prospect and mine on conservation land in Karangahake in 2009, using an existing underground mine that has been in operation at various times between 1892 and 1992. It is legal to mine on conservation land in New Zealand if the government and local council grant a permit and if land access is given from the department of conservation.As of May there were 43 active mines on conservation land in New Zealand, according to the ministry of business, innovation and employment.New Talisman have all the consents they need and the government insists mining activity won’t affect the historic gorge. The only thing standing in their path is local opposition.Powell has vowed to keep up the fight. “We will continue to put our bodies on the line to stop New Talisman working in the mountain,” she said.Note: This article has been updated to add in extra information provided on Talisman’s mine.

Somalia’s internet has returned after an outage of more than three weeks cost the Horn of Africa nation about $10m a day.Hormuud Telecom, the country’s largest telecom company, announced the restoration of service in a message to subscribers.The loss of internet service sparked anger across Somalia and affected the central and southern parts of the country including the capital, Mogadishu. The government called it a “major disaster.”Officials and internet providers attributed the problem to a commercial ship that they said cut an undersea cable.Major companies reported millions of dollars in revenue losses. University studies were disrupted.The internet outage also complicated efforts to combat a nationwide drought that has half of the country’s 12 million people in need of assistance.Residents in the capital celebrated the return of service. “This helps a lot,” Abdirashid Duale, the CEO of the largest international Somali remittance company, Dahabshiil, told The Associated Press. “The internet outage has affected many of our customers.”The lack of internet service also stranded patients who were seeking medical attention abroad as they couldn’t access online paperwork.“The internet outage had my father stuck in Mogadishu. Now we can take him to India having received all medical paperwork via internet,” said Nur Hussein.Somalia is trying to emerge from a quarter-century of conflict. The fragile central government remains a target for the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group, which often carries out deadly attacks in the capital."

Two Peruvian brothers are recovering in hospital in the Chilean city of Antofagasta after being doused with petrol and set alight by a mob of Chilean fishermen in the port city of Tocopilla. Juan Jiménez Ninaja and José Díaz Ninaja were left with second- and third-degree burns to over half their bodies after the attack. The two brothers had collected seaweed in the region for five years, helping to supply a multimillion-dollar aquaculture export industry. Mainly shipped to Japan, China and France, the plants are used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals as well as being eaten. The incident took place amid an increasingly heated debate over the recent surge in migration to Chile, mainly from other Latin American and Caribbean countries, and growing racial tensions in the Antofagasta region. According to Elizabeth Andrade, a Peruvian social worker and one of the leaders of a migrant squatter camp in the city of Antofagasta, the attack was triggered by competition between seaweed collectors. The brothers had received threats over the last few months and were in the process of clearing out their hut to leave Tocopilla when they were set upon, Andrade said. In recent years, 64 camps have sprung up around the city of Antofagasta. The camps’ occupants receive some support from local authorities in terms of security and access to healthcare and education, while pro-migrant Chilean NGOs have also been working with the migrants to improve living conditions. Andrade said the local press bore some responsibility for fanning resentment against immigrants, by exaggerating the number of foreigners involved in criminal activities and calling for the expulsion of all immigrants. “It’s really difficult for migrants to adapt to Chilean society, as well as for Chileans to live alongside so many foreigners – they’re not used to it. But in the last couple of years there’s been a real surge in racial discrimination,” she said.Migrants’ rights activists say that the incident underlines the urgent need for new legislation to replace outdated immigration law imposed by the Pinochet dictatorship in 1975, along with well-planned policies to deal with the recent surge in migration to Chile."
146,"The Bank of England on Tuesday unveiled a new polymer �10 note featuring 19th century novelist Jane Austen, in a move to replace paper �5, �10 and �20 with secure plastic notes.

The new £10 note featuring Jane Austen has been unveiled on the 200th anniversary of the author’s death, complete with a quote about reading – said by one of her characters who has no interest in books. Austen becomes the first female writer (following in the footsteps of William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens) to feature on a banknote.The note, launched by the Bank of England at Austen’s resting place, Winchester Cathedral, includes an image of the writer and one of her most beloved characters, Elizabeth Bennet. There are also illustrations of her writing table and her brother Edward Austen Knight’s home, Godmersham Park in Kent, thought to be a source of inspiration. But it is the quote that will raise eyebrows among Austen enthusiasts. At first glance the line from Pride and Prejudice – “I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!” – seems a good choice. However, the words were spoken by one of Austen’s most deceitful characters, Caroline Bingley, who has no interest in books. She is sidling up to Mr Darcy, whom she would like as a husband. He is reading a book, so she sits next to him and pretends to read alongside him. Speaking at Winchester Cathedral, the Bank of England’s governor, Mark Carney, explained why Austen was chosen – and the technical aspects of the notes.  He said: “Our banknotes serve as repositories of the country’s collective memory, promoting awareness of the United Kingdom’s glorious history and highlighting the contributions of its greatest citizens. “Austen’s novels have a universal appeal and speak as powerfully today as they did when they were first published.” Turning to practical matters, he said: “The new £10 will be printed on polymer, making it safer, stronger and cleaner. The note will also include a new tactile feature on the £10 to help the visually impaired, ensuring the nation’s money is as inclusive as possible.” It joins the Churchill £5 in the first family of polymer UK banknotes; a £20 note featuring JMW Turner will follow in 2020. The £10 note has security features that the Bank says make it very difficult to counterfeit. It is expected to last at least two-and-a-half times longer than paper £10 notes – about five years in total.  The new tactile feature is a series of raised dots in the top left-hand corner, developed in conjunction with the RNIB, the charity that supports people with sight loss. This is in addition to the elements already incorporated in UK banknotes for visually impaired people: the tiered sizing, bold numerals, raised print and differing colour palettes.Austen fans will have to wait until later this year before they can begin to use the notes. They will be issued on 14 September and the public will begin to see them in the following days and weeks. The Bank hopes featuring Austen will help it counter accusations of sexism for not featuring more women on notes. The author follows Florence Nightingale and Elizabeth Fry in featuring on notes.Tuesday’s banknote launch is one of a series of events taking place to mark the 200th anniversary of Austen’s death, including the unveiling of a statue in Basingstoke, near her birthplace. Austen, who wrote keenly about money, might have been interested in research from Aviva claiming that the £10 pound note has a relative purchasing power of only 13p compared with what it could buy in 1817."

164,"The Tirupati Laddu caused an annual loss of over ?140 crore to the temple administration of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam for the last three years. The loss was owed to its subsidised price and free distribution to devotees, according to reports. The laddu is being sold at a price of ?25 per piece while its actual cost was ?32.50, reports said."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowTirupati, Feb 19 (PTI) The most sought-after Tirupati Laddu has caused an annual loss of over Rs 140 crore to the cash-rich administration of Lord Venkateswara hill shrine for the last three years owing to its subsidised price and free distribution to some devotees, temple sources said.The mouth-watering sweet dish has been sold by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) at a subsidised price of Rs 25 per piece for the last 11 years while the actual cost was about Rs 32.50, the sources said.The laddu, made at the massive kitchen close to the shrine at nearby Tirumala, is in great demand among devotees, who throng the shrine from different parts of the country throughout the year.In 2016, about ten crore pieces of laddu (ball-shaped sweet) were made and sold, they told PTI.Besides the burden caused by subsidy, TTD also incurs more loss selling the laddu at Rs 10 per piece to devotees who opt for free darshan and wait for several hours in long queues, resulting in a loss of about Rs 23 crore, the sources said.The introduction of one free laddu to each devotee who treks 11-kilometre long stairway leading to the temple from the foot of the hills also adds about Rs 22.7 crore to the annual loss.The scheme was introduced in October 2013 with an aim to encourage the age-old traditional way of reaching the sacred hills on foot.Since then, on an average about 70 lakh devotees visit the temple by climbing the hills on foot annually, they said.More than 70 lakh devotees who avail Rs 300 special entry darshan and Rs 500 VIP darshan tickets were also getting two laddus free.However, the sources said the TTD was not keen on increasing the price of the laddu to offset the losses and might consider cutting down the number of free laddus given to ticket holders.Interestingly, the laddu used as prasad was introduced in the 2000-year old hill temple only about 100 years ago during the British era.Earlier, atherasam or aresu, a sweet made of jaggery and rice, used to be the prasad (offering) at the temple for ages.During the rule of mahants designated and posted as Vichaarana Karthas of the temple by the British, the laddu prasad was introduced, the sources added.

The caterpillars, which feed on the leaves of shea trees, are made up of more than 60% protein. The startup was founded by Kahitouo Hien, a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley in 2011.","With acute malnutrition affecting more than 10% of people in Burkina Faso, an innovative startup is mass-producing dried shea caterpillars high in proteinMorgane Le Cam in Ouagadougou for Thomson Reuters Foundation, part of the Guardian development network

Small black cylinders simmer in two pots, emitting a pungent and smoky smell.This is not someone’s kitchen, however. It is the offices of agrifood company FasoPro, which double as a caterpillar laboratory.Kahitouo Hien walks hastily from one room to another, his T-shirt bearing an unusual slogan: “Small caterpillars, big pleasure.”“Caterpillars are made up of more than 60% protein,” says Hien. “They are among the most nutritious foods available in Burkina Faso.”According to the World Food Programme, acute malnutrition in Burkina Faso stands at 10.4%.Poor harvests, caused by drought, mean there is a lack of food and diverse nutrients in the country. Hien aims to change that. In 2015, he set up an improvised laboratory in Ouagadougou to industrialise the production of shea caterpillars – insects that feed on the leaves of shea trees.Traditionally eaten in many parts of Burkina Faso, caterpillars are now sold at markets throughout the country as a tasty treat. But no one had thought of industrialising their production until now, says Hien.Hien decided to start his business while studying engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2011. “I wrote a business plan on caterpillars because I’ve been eating them since childhood,” he says. Hien’s tutor encouraged him to take part in the university’s global social venture competition, and he went on to win the prize for best social startup in 2012. Armed with the prize and his degree, Hien worked on developing his business for two years before finally selling his first caterpillars to market traders.“It didn’t start off well,” he recalls. “Our price – 3,000 Central African francs (about £4) for one 500g pack of fresh caterpillars – was just too high.”He came up with a solution the day his steriliser broke down. “Bags of fresh caterpillars were piling up and the insects were drying out,” Hien said. “We had to find a way to shift them.” In January 2016, he launched a new product: dried caterpillars. At 650 francs (85p) for a 70g pack, the crunchy caterpillars were an instant hit. “We sold 30,000 units last year, and hope to hit 100,000 this year,” he says.Yelo Kam, one of his six employees, meticulously cuts labels for caterpillar bags. “Kahitouo is an ambitious man, a visionary,” she says, without lifting her eyes from her work. “You have to be brave to hang in there.”Hien’s venture was given €42,000 (£36,000) in 2016 after winning a French competition that rewards social initiatives. “The money will allow us to attend regional fairs, as well as to find markets and partners in west Africa,” he says.Hien still pursues his first passion: research. For several months, his team has been working on ways to breed caterpillars in a controlled environment, rather than in nature.“Once mature, caterpillars normally hide in the ground to grow – a stage that is only possible in porous soil,” Hien explains. “Yet with soils drying up, caterpillars are becoming rarer.”While initial results are encouraging, the company needs more funds to finish its research, but the road ahead does not scare Hien. “I like taking risks. Challenges spur me on.” And he’s already thinking of his next prototype: a cricket biscuit."

An Italian restaurateur fed up with his customers’ lunches being interrupted by rowdy children has come up with a novel solution: a discount for well-behaved families.Antonio Ferrari, who owns a wine bar in the northern city of Padua that caters to families on Sundays, came up with the idea when he spotted a party of 11 at one of his tables, including five children sitting “with much composure”.Ferrari rewarded the group with a 5% sconto, and has since bestowed the same discount on two other families with well-mannered children.Ferrari told the Guardian he estimated about 30% of parents did not know how to handle their children at lunchtime, and that too often children run around the restaurant and bother other customers, forcing his waiting staff to swerve to avoid them.Long family lunches, sometimes stretching to three hours, are still an honoured culinary and social tradition in Italy, though less prevalent than they once were. Usually the meal involves an antipasto – bruschetta or platters of prosciutto are fairly typical – and then a pasta dish, followed by a meat dish and then vegetables.Unlike the disciplined French children portrayed by Pamela Druckerman in her book Bringing up Bébé who sit quietly through restaurant meals as their parents engage in adult conversation, Italian families are stereotypically more rowdy, with loud behaviour often indulged by parents who see it as as a normal childhood phenomenon.  Ferrari – who does not have children – was at pains to point out that his intention was not to be too judgmental, telling Corriere della Sera: “I imagine how difficult parenting is today.”Nevertheless, he thought something had to be done to rein-in children splashing water in the restaurant’s bathrooms and bothering other customers by running around tables.He recalled some parents telling him his restaurant was essentially public, and that they could do what they want. But he added: “I’m responsible for what happens in it.”The party who earned the coveted discount were delighted by the news and left a €30 (£25) tip, Ferrari said. "

193,"Indian Air Force will induct the country's first indigenous all-weather airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) system, also called the 'eye in the sky', on February 14, the first day of Aero India 2017. The system will have the capability to detect incoming fighters, cruise missiles and even drones from both Pakistan and China, according to reports."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowThis news couldn't have come at a better time than this. On February 14, the day Aero India 2017 begins, the IAF will be the proud owner of its very own indigenous all-weather airborne early warning and control system popularly known as the AEW&C.This aerial platform is meant to be a force multiplier that will guide the IAF's fighter aircraft during combat. It will have the capability to detect incoming fighters, cruise missiles and even drones from both Pakistan and China.For Dr. Christopher, Chairman, DRDO it will be a fine day indeed. He was earlier the Programme Director (airborne early warning and control system) and Director, Centre for Air-Borne Systems in the DRDO before being elevated to the topmost post.Speaking exclusively to India Today, he said that his association with the early warning system programme goes back to 1985 when it all started. He also had a narrow escape having flown on the same test aircraft as a flight engineer that crashed in January 1999. 'I flew on that same test aircraft, the previous sortie, the last but one sortie before it crashed,' he told India Today.The indigenous AEW&C system has been developed by Bengaluru based CABS and integrated onto a Brazilian built Embraer-145 aircraft. It is equipped with a 240-degree coverage radar and can detect, identify and classify threats in the surveillance area and also act as a Command and Control Centre to support Air Defence operations.Dr. CP Ramanarayanan, Director General - Aeronautical Systems (Aero) participated in the final trials of the AEW&C. 'I was onboard this flight in Jodhpur and it was so heartening to see all the functional performance requirements were met meticulously,' he says. According to him the users (IAF) observed that this was such a trial they have never undergone. So while the second AEW&C will be handed over to the IAF in a few months time, the third which was initially to be with CABS, will also be handed over to the IAF.LOTS OF CATCHING UP TO DOChina today has more than 20 AWACS and Pakistan has 8 AWACS, India on the other hand has just this one AEW&C and 3 Phalcon systems. To play catch up, in March 2016, the Defence Acquisition Council cleared the building of 2 AWACS-India.These systems will be much more powerful and capable than the AEW&C and will involve mounting an indigenous 360-degree coverage AESA radar on an Airbus A-330 jet. 'As far as the functionality is concerned, both are identical. However, the new one is much more capable with extended range and better angular coverage,' Dr. S Christopher says. The requirement of the IAF is for 8 AWACS-I aircraft.As of today, Dr. Christopher says the file will be moved to the Cabinet Committee on Security and they are hoping to secure clearance anytime soon with a developmental timeframe of close to 7 years.Also read: IAF to get 'eye in the sky' to snoop on Pakistani and Chinese air force   Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

He, however, didn't mention UP CM Akhilesh Yadav's name. This came amid reports that some Mulayam's loyalists, who were denied tickets by the SP, are now contesting on the Lok Dal ticket."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe spring may have gone out of Mulayam Singh Yadav's step after he was unseated from the leadership of the Samajwadi Party by his son Akhilesh Yadav, but he still retains his ability to sting. Evidence of that came at the rally that he addressed this afternoon at Jaswantnagar in his home district of Etwah. He  came here asking for votes for his brother Shivpal Yadav but what was more interesting was his open support for a Lok Dal candidate from the Etwah seat.Mulayam rooting for the Lok Dal candidate is significant. The party exists mainly on paper and is distinct from the Rashtriya Lok Dal, which is headed by Ajit Singh. After Mulayam Singh Yadav was tossed out as the president of his party, he, along with Shivpal, toyed with the idea of taking over the Lok Dal, but ultimately decided against it.Speculation abounds in political circles that close to 40 of the duo's loyalists who were denied tickets by the SP are now contesting on the Lok Dal ticket. If a handful of them manage to win, they could strengthen Mulayam's hand in the event of a hung Assembly.Also read: Samajwadi feud: Mulayam-Akhilesh fight leaves Shivpal supporters in limbo YADAV CLAN ABSENT AT SHIVPAL RALLYAlthough Etwah happens to be the family bastion of the Yadav family, not one member of the larger Yadav clan has been out seeking votes for Shivpal. Conspicuous by their absence from today's rally were the chief minister and MPs Ram Gopal Yadav, Dimple Yadav, Dharmendar Yyadav, Tej Pratap Yadav and Akshay Yadav.A significant feature of Shivpal's campaign and today's rally was that votes were sought in the name of Mulayam Singh Yadav and the development work that has taken place in the district during his time as chief minister and by Shivpal as the state irrigation and PWD minister. No mention was made of Akhilesh Yadav or any of that development work done by his government.Speaker after speaker, Mulayam Singh Yadav included, extolled the electorate to ensure that Shivpal wins by a margin bigger than the 83,000 vote margin he won by the last time. The message was not lost out on anyone.

202,"Social media users have criticised the cover of the 125th-anniversary issue of fashion magazine 'Vogue' for an alleged lack of diversity. The cover has featured only one plus-size model, Ashley Graham. Readers have also accused 'Vogue' of featuring only light to medium skin-toned models. Further, it has been slammed for reportedly photoshopping Gigi Hadid's arm to cover Graham's torso."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowOne wouldn't have thought that a plus-size model could feature in advertisements, let alone the cover page of leading fashion magazines, even a decade back.But that's just the kind of progress we have made over time. Fashion, today, is about celebrating all body types with utter confidence and oomph.So it doesn't come as a surprise that plus-size supermodel Ashley Graham would feature in the upcoming edition of Vogue. The March 2017 issue of the magazine is celebrating beauty in all its forms.Also read: This hot plus-size model finally has a Barbie in her name With the cover page tag of 'Women Rule! Fashion's Fearless Female', the issue features Ashley Graham, Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner, Adwoa Aboah, Liu Wen, Vittoria Ceretti, and Imaan Hammam--all of them in black turtleneck tops, and multi-coloured, high-waist beach shorts. Vogue claims that this issue is revolutionary, and as their cover announces, 'No norm is the new norm'.And while we quite believe that, some online critics have criticised Ashley's appearance on the cover. According to them the model, who openly celebrates her size and cellulite, had been posed in a certain way to hide her plus-sized body. Some have even accused the magazine of digitally altering the image to make Ashley look thinner.Ashley, countering these remarks, commented on her Instagram that 'I chose to pose like that...no one told me to do anything'. Despite this sort of criticism, the Vogue cover actually does make quite an impact. These women hailing from all over the world--from China to the Netherlands--and with different body types, have one thing in common. They all look equally stunning.

First published on Thu 2 Feb 2017 06.18 EST

It is a moment that is seared on to the consciousness of Frank Lampard and every Chelsea fan – particularly those who were there. Bolton Wanderers away; 30 April 2005. Lampard surges around one opponent, cuts inside another and thrashes a low shot into the net.If Chelsea win, they win the league title. For the first time since 1955. And in their centenary year, too. Lampard has set them on their way and the celebrations that follow are frenzied. He is buried beneath a scrum of team-mates. Even some of the substitutes jump on.Lampard is not finished. On a quick break, he finds himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper. He walks the ball around him to make it 2-0. Game over. Chelsea are the champions. Lampard is a champion. Not bad for a player who they said would not make it to the top.He was not finished. It was the second major honour of his career, following on from the League Cup triumph in February of that year and Lampard would go on to claim 11 of them – all with his beloved Chelsea, the club he joined from West Ham United in 2001. The highlight, surely, was the Champions League final in 2012, when he captained Chelsea, in the absence of the suspended John Terry, to the penalty shootout victory against Bayern Munich.Now, Lampard is finished. At the age of 38 and after 21 years in the professional game, he has decided to retire. He does so with three Premier League titles to his name; four FA Cups; two League Cups; the Champions League and the Europa League. In other words, the clean sweep at club level.With England, it never went to plan, although he is hardly the only player who can say that. He was excellent at Euro 2004, scoring three times as England reached the quarter-finals but his subsequent tournament appearances at the World Cups of 2006, 2010 and 2014 were disappointments.Lampard missed his penalty in the quarter-final shootout defeat against Portugal in 2006 and, four years later, his glorious shot in the last 16 against Germany bounced off the crossbar and over the line – except that the officials ruled it as no goal. It would have made the score 2-2. Instead, England slumped to a 4-1 defeat.In many respects, it summed up how Lampard’s international career, which yielded 106 caps and 29 goals, came down on the wrong side of the margins. It was shaped by his relationship in central midfield with Steven Gerrard, or the lack of one. The Lampard-Gerrard conundrum was debated endlessly.Nevertheless, Lampard goes down as a Premier League great and he owes it all to his phenomenal work ethic and mental toughness; the desire that he has always had to prove his worth – and others wrong.“When Frank was a youngster, I can remember a lot of people saying: ‘What’s all the fuss? He’s a good player but he isn’t that good,” says Tony Carr, the former West Ham academy director, under whom Lampard developed. “He never got to play for England schoolboys and I can remember Harry Redknapp, the West Ham manager, asking me why Frank wasn’t playing for England youth, when he was a youth-team player at the club.“Harry rang the England coach, who was Dave Burnside, and Dave said: ‘We know about him but we think we’ve got better.’ That sort of thing was a fantastic spur for Frank. With his bloody‑mindedness, his dedication, the way he constantly tried to improve himself – he made himself the ultimate pro. I’ve got nothing but complete admiration for him.”As the tributes came in on Thursday, the one from Terry stood out. Lampard’s long-time Chelsea team‑mate described him as a gentleman and a leader. But Terry also made reference to how Lampard had wrung every last drop from his talent. “You were the best trainer by a million miles every single day, inspiring me and everyone at the club,” Terry wrote. “You stayed out [after training] working on your finishing – 20 goals a year wasn’t good enough for you; you wanted 25, 30 goals. I will miss you getting four cones and doing sprints after training – setting the example for the academy kids.”Lampard is synonymous with consistency and durability; only Ryan Giggs and Gareth Barry have made more Premier League appearances than his 609 while his run of 164 consecutive matches remains a record for an outfield player. He read the game with intelligence – this is a man who recorded one of Britain’s highest Mensa scores – and it is questionable whether he got the credit he deserves for his exceptional short and long passing.In the end, though, Lampard was defined by his goals; the timing of the runs, the technique and the power of the execution. He says the two at Bolton were his best with the one he scored for Chelsea at Aston Villa in 2013, which took him past Bobby Tambling’s all-time record for the club, not far behind.When Lampard left Chelsea in 2014 to finish his career at Manchester City and New York City, he did so with 211 goals from 649 appearances for them. It is doubtful whether the mark will be overhauled. In terms of the Premier League, only Alan Shearer, Wayne Rooney and Andy Cole have scored more than his 177 goals and they, of course, are strikers.His numbers are mind‑boggling and Terry, Tambling and others have described him as Chelsea’s greatest player. His next move looks likely to be into coaching. Whatever he does, Lampard will give it his all."

Joshi, who had worked as an RSS pracharak for a significant part of his life, was shot dead a few hundred meters from his rented house in Chuna Khadan area of Dewas on December 29, 2007.Only the next day on December 30, a particular community was targeted and four members of a family were killed as Joshi's associates tried to give the murder a communal colour.Later it was suspected that Joshi was eliminated by his own associates so that the police could not track down the saffron terror trail that was allegedly involved in several blasts, including the Samjhauta blasts. Sadhvi Pragya, who was alleged to be in an integral part of the saffron terror network, was later arrested in connection with Sunil Joshi's murder.MURDER CASE TRANSFERRED TO NIA IN 2011The Sunil Joshi murder case was transferred to the NIA in 2011, which probed its connection with terror strikes that were linked with right-wing Hindu extremist organisation Abhinav Bharat.A few months after the NDA came to power at the Centre in 2014, the NIA filed a chargesheet in the Joshi murder case in a special court in Bhopal and ruled out any connection with other terror strikes allegedly carried out by extreme right-wing groups.Also read | Victim of 2008 Malegaon blast opposes Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur's bailThe case was transferred to the Dewas court in September 2014. A year later, the court framed charges against Sadhvi Pragya Singh and seven others on the basis of the investigation carried out by Dewas police.Today's judgement, which came a little more than nine years after Sunil Joshi was murdered, has not helped answer the questions behind the mysterious murder. No one, at least from among those who were charged with the murder, have been found to have killed Sunil Joshi. Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17. What did lockdown achieve then?

the IPL final. Even after losing all three tosses, we won the series,

behind the stumps. I am new to the limited overs format and I keep
taking help. A lot of credit goes to them. Yes, that too and that one
over from Jordan to Yuvi. We thought 175-180, but that over took us to
200. Credit to Chahal, he knows the ground better. I have a lot of faith in him and he plays his cricket with confidence.

bowled in the poweplay in the IPL and Virat has the confidence in me to
give me the ball. I plan according to how the batsman plays. Even Dhoni
used to tell me what the batsman is going to play. Mishy bowled well in
the last match as well, looking at him I get the confidence to toss the
ball up.Eoin Morgan: We lost two in batsmen and it really hurt us. It was an
excellent spell from Chahal. Credit should be given where it is due.
India played the better cricket today. Beautiful wicket to bat and we
would have taken 190-200 at the beginning. We take a lot of things. The
biggest thing is our bowling. We showed improvement in our bowling
department.

Stay tuned for the run chase.England were very inconsistent tonight. Whether it was the short boundaries, or the dew, one can't say but surely they would not have planned to concede 118 in the last 9 overs. Of those, only two overs went below 10, with the lower value being 8. Tymal Mills and Ben Stokes were impressive, finishing with 1/32 each in their 4 overs while we saw the other side of Chris Jordan tonight, going for 56 in his 4 overs. Strangely, Plunkett bowled just 2 overs with Morgan preferring to bowl 6 overs out of Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, yielding a total of 53 runs without any wicket.Pandya's run out from the last ball & India finish 202-6 - will we chase it & win the series? #INDvENGFind out ??? https://t.co/MZ6wQXuneh pic.twitter.com/yuSEivZQKHSo India finish on a commanding total.

227,"The Pufferfish, commonly known as Blowfish and Fugu, is considered a delicacy in Japan even though it is fatally poisonous. Reportedly 1200 times more poisonous than cyanide and without a known antidote, Fugu poisoning can cause death by asphyxiation within 10 minutes. Japan strictly controls its restaurant preparation by law, and chefs take 3-10 years' training to prepare it properly. "," Jump to navigationSpeak NowTrust the Japanese to do something the rest of the world can't even fathom, and ace it!For starters, the fish dish in question is called Fugu in Japan, or pufferfish, as the rest of the world knows it. Though it comes in various varieties, we most commonly know this fish as 'blowfish'--yes, the one that inflates at the prospect of any threat.First things first, this is what the pufferfish looks like:Okay, that's not a pretty picture. And that's not even an adult pufferfish. Let's just save you the gory details and get to the point. Here's what you REALLY need to know about this Japanese delicacy:1. It takes a chef three to ten years in training to be able to cut the fish right so it doesn't remain poisonous for the consumer.2. Restaurant preparation of Fugu is strictly controlled by law in Japan and several other countries.3. Accidental poisoning by Fugu can lead to death within 10 minutes.4. Fugu contains lethal amounts of the poison tetrodotoxin in its inner organs, especially the liver, ovaries, and the eyes; the skin is usually non-poisonous.5. The poison in Fugu paralyzes the muscles while the victim stays fully conscious. The poisoned victim is not able to breathe, and eventually dies from asphyxiation.6. According to Wikipedia, Fugu poison is 1200 times stronger than cyanide, and has no known antidote yet.And when you can ignore or accept all that--and trust the guy in the kitchen with your life--they say Fugu tastes pretty much like nothing else in the world. Most chefs describe Fugu's taste as ""indescribable"" (well, yes).The funniest part, however, is--while some activists are fighting for the fish to be banned in Japan, some other are proposing even legalising the consumption of the poisonous liver, which they claim is the tastiest part of the fish.So, the next time you're in Japan, would you like to taste something ""indescribable"" at the risk of your life?

I’ve been dodging that bullet for the last couple of days. But this is the last one. I’ll leave it all out here in Australia and if I can’t walk for another five months, that’s ok. Rafa is the biggest challenge. This court allows me to be offensive. I’m probably his number one fan. We’ve had some epic battles over the years. It would be unreal to play here. I don’t think both of us though we were going to be here potentially playing in the final because I went to open his academy in Mallorca with him a few months back and I told him ‘I wish we could do a charity match or something’, but I was on one leg and he had the wrist injury and we were playing some mini tennis with some juniors and we were like ‘it’s the best we can do right now’.

Fourth set: Federer 7-5, 6-3, 1-6, 4-4 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka finds the line with a forehand winner for 15-0. Federer wastes a challenge for no apparent reason. On we go. Wawrinka clips a forehand into the corner to lead 30-0. But Federer enjoys a little slice of luck when a forehand clips the top of the net and forces Wawrinka forward. Federer picks him off with a backhand down the line for 30-15, then smashes for 30-all. Suddenly it’s an awkward game for Wawrinka, who’s relieved to see a Federer backhand flash wide. Wawrinka nets a forehand, though, and the game goes to deuce, but he holds after a couple of staunch points.

Fourth set: Federer 7-5, 6-3, 1-6, 1-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka bangs an ace down for 15-0. Federer responds with a peach of a backhand pass from left to right for 15-all, which should make him feel a bit better about the way this has gone in the past 30 minutes. The game goes to 30-all and a baseline rally ensues. It ends with Wawrinka sending a backhand long and Federer has a break point. A brutally strong forehand from Wawrinka forces an error from Federer, whose forehand goes long for deuce. A double-fault from Wawrinka gifts Federer a second chance, though. Here’s another long rally. Federer’s in control, though, and there’s a hint of desperation about Wawrinka’s final shot, a backhand that drifts long. Federer breaks to stop the rot.

The wind was taken out of his sails when Wawrinka went for that medical timeout and he hasn’t been able to handle the situation. Wawrinka’s loose. With nothing to lose, he’s just come back out and spanked the fuzz off the ball. He earns a break point when Federer sends a forehand wide. Federer serves wide and moves forward; Wawrinka just wallops a backhand pass from left to right to seal a third successive break. Federer has lost from two sets up on four occasions. He’s in serious peril of it happening for a fifth time now.

That medical timeout seems to have affected Federer more than Wawrinka, who takes a 30-0 lead with an ace out wide. Another storming backhand from Wawrinka brings up three set points and Federer nets a backhand. A horrible, unfocused third set from Federer and the 2014 champion is right back in this!

Japan’s long wait for a homegrown sumo grand champion has ended after Kisenosato became the first Japanese wrestler to reach the ancient sport’s pinnacle in almost two decades.The 30-year-old became the sport’s 72nd yokozuna, or grand champion, after Japan’s sumo association approved his promotion on Wednesday in a move purists hope will mark the start of a challenge to years of dominance by overseas wrestlers.The last Japan-born wrestler to reach the top rank was Wakanohana in 1998.The 178kg Kisenosato – who has been criticised for letting several tournament titles slip through his hands – became a serious contender for promotion after winning the new year’s contest in Tokyo with a record of 14 victories and one defeat.At a ceremony at his stable on Wednesday morning, Kisenosato said he accepted his promotion “with great humility”. He added: “I will show devotion and try not to disgrace the title of yokozuna.”In recent years sumo has been dominated by wrestlers from Mongolia, Hawaii and Samoa.Earlier this week, with his promotion all but a formality, Kisenosato told reporters that the rank of yokozuna came with a special responsibility. “I feel grateful to all the people that have helped me,” said Kisenosato, who paid tribute to his late stable master, Naruto. “If I had not met my former trainer I would not have got to where I have now,” he said. “I have nothing but gratitude.”Kisenosato’s ascent to sumo’s summit did not come easily: his historic victory on Sunday came at the end of his 73rd tournament as a professional, which is more than it has taken any other wrestler since 1926 to reach the top rank.His addition to the yokozuna ranks is also expected to help improve sumo’s image, after a decade in which it has been rocked by a series of scandals, including bullying, drug taking and allegations of match fixing.Kisenosato joins three other wrestlers at the rank of yokozuna, all of whom were born in Mongolia: Kakuryu, Harumafuji and Hakuho. The latter is considered by many to be the greatest sumo wrestler of all time with 37 tournament titles.Foreign-born wrestlers’ domination of sumo began with the 287kg Konishiki in the 1990s and continued into the next decade with the arrival of Asashoryu from Mongolia whose unpredictable behaviour outside the ring occasionally took the sheen off his brilliant performances inside it."

It was a departure that one of her colleagues described as “rather stylish”, coming exactly 25 years and a day since Alexandra Shulman’s appointment as editor of British Vogue – and a century after the fashion bible was founded.With both a style and magazine described as a “very British”, Shulman’s departure also marks the end of a rivalry much-loved by fashion journalists between her and the equally British Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of US Vogue and said to be the model for the terrifying Meryl Streep character in The Devil Wears Prada.In departing, Shulman indicated that recent ventures beyond the magazine – a behind-the-scenes BBC documentary, Absolutely Fashion, and a well-received book, Inside Vogue: A Diary of My 100th Year – had made her realise there was a life beyond a magazine she had edited since the age of 34.“I realised that I very much wanted to experience a different life and look forward to a future separate to Vogue,” she said.During Shulman’s tenure at Vogue – circulation has increased 12% to 195,053 in the past 25 years – she has championed both British fashion and London fashion week, now one of the “big four” fashion events.She has a reputation for supporting British designers without quite fitting the image of a perfectly stylish fashion editor. While other international Vogue editors such as Wintour in the US and Carine Roitfeld in France are considered icy style icons, Shulman laughingly told the Guardian of being presented in one feature as the “chain-smoking 50-year-old Toyota-driving divorcee”.When she was appointed it was suggested that she “could become better acquainted with a hairbrush”, according to the New York Times. But Shulman used her reputation to define her magazine. “She was never starry in a very conscious way. It was quite British, just like her magazine,” said one senior colleague.While US Vogue is known for its glossy and expensive US sportswear shoots, the British edition is considered more creative and original, even bohemian. Although the rivalry with Wintour is real, according to magazine insiders, it is entirely professional. In the BBC documentary Shulman is shown scooping a planned Wintour exclusive by putting Rihanna on the cover. “It’s all journalistic pride. They get on fine,” said one senior colleague.Plum Sykes, contributing editor of US Vogue who started her career as a junior assistant under Shulman in the 1990s, said: “She is very British, very laid-back. I am sure her Manolos are muddy. But she has done a good job, especially for British fashion.”Shulman has said: “It does amaze me when people say ‘Well, you don’t look like the editor of Vogue’. Because I am the editor of Vogue. So what else does the editor of Vogue look like?”In an interview with the Observer she also talked openly about using Xanax to deal with panic attacks. Given that her life might appear “sort of lovely and easy” to outsiders, she said: “I think it’s quite good to show you’ve had bad things happen as well.”Turning 60 later this year, those close to Shulman said she was still to decide what she would do next. A former newspaper columnist who wrote her first novel, Can We Still Be Friends, a few years ago, she is expected to write more. Names in the frame to replace her include current deputy Emily Sheffield, the sister of Samantha Cameron.The oldest of three children brought up in Belgravia, she attended St Paul’s school in London. After a degree in social anthropology from the University of Sussex she worked briefly for two recording labels before becoming a secretary at Over 21 magazine. Her first journalistic job was at Tatler, also part of Condé Nast and which had also employed her brother as art director.Within eight years she was editing men’s magazine GQ, where she increased sales by 30%, and two years after that she was made editor of Vogue.Her mother, Drusilla Beyfus, was Vogue associate editor in the 70s while her father, Milton Shulman, had been Vogue film critic, prompting Coleridge to say that Vogue was “almost in her blood” when she was appointed.Despite this, she has always told interviewers that having two parents who were journalists meant she had “wanted to be a hairdresser”, or a musician.In 2015 she wrote about how glad she was to return to work when her only son, now 21 and a history of art student, was 15 weeks old.Although she has refused to publish articles lauding diets or cosmetic surgery, Vogue has been no stranger to controversy. In the early 1990s a Kate Moss shoot was criticised for encouraging “heroin chic” and in 1997, the watchmaker Omega pulled an ad campaign because of the issue.Early on, Shulman appeared to dismiss these complaints by saying “Not many people have actually said to me that they have looked at my magazine and decided to become anorexic.”But in 2009, she wrote a letter to major international fashion houses complaining that their “minuscule” sample sizes were forcing fashion editors to use models with “jutting bones”. Her January 2017 issue featured a plus-size model, Ashley Graham, on the cover.On the weight issue, she said: “What is an issue is to try to make young women feel more comfortable with how they look in general and not feel they have to look a cookie-cutter way to be a success in life. That’s really what I’m interested in.”"
243,"The Supreme Court has asked the BCCI and Centre to propose names for an interim administrative committee for BCCI.

The apex court also allowed the BCCI and Center to suggest names for the committee.BCCI and the Center will submit their suggestions by January 27 and the Supreme Court will pass the order on January 30.The Supreme Court also asserted that people over 70 years will not be appointed BCCI administrators. The Center was represented by Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi who contended that the Supreme Court should hold back the order as the government was mulling over a legislation to regulate sports bodies in India. However, the Supreme Court asked the Center why it had not made a representation so far.WATCH FULL VIDEO HEREOn January 20 hearing, two lawyers had proposed a list of names for the interim committee to the Supreme Court in a sealed envelope. But some of the names suggested were aged over 70 and the top court had immediately raised questions.In a landmark verdict, the Supreme Court had cracked the whip on a defiant BCCI on January 2 for not complying with its orders to implement the Lodha Committee reforms. The apex court sacked its president Anurag Thakur and secretary Ajay Shirke in a historic judgement passed in the new year. For the time being, BCCI CEO Rahul Johri has been heading the board.The Supreme Court also said BCCI office bearers over 70 years or whose office period has extended for over nine years or those who have a criminal conviction should be removed.THE BACKGROUNDIt all started when the spot-fixing scandal broke out during the Indian Premier League in 2013 leading to developments that forced the top court to intervene.Subsequently, the Mudgal Committee was appointed by the Supreme Court, which submitted its report and pointed out irregularities pertaining to the IPL. To help things move further, the Supreme Court appointed a panel in January 2015 headed by former Chief Justice of India, RM Lodha. In July, the panel suspended IPL franchises Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) for two years, while the teams' co-owners Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra were banned for life from cricket.Later, the Lodha panel suggested a set of comprehensive reforms for the BCCI to implement. A few of those recommendations were challenged by BCCI and then the apex court had a final word and set a deadline for the the board to implement the suggested reforms in its totality. BCCI setting dangerous precedent with its defiance of Supreme CourtBut, the BCCI continued to stand its ground. Meanwhile, the apex court also asked Thakur to file an affidavit to explain why he had asked the ICC to interfere in the proceedings and submit it to the court on October 17. SGM's were held and the BCCI decided to decline certain orders of the Lodha panel.After the continued defiance, the Lodha committee asked the Supreme Court to sack the 'top brass' of the BCCI and install former Home Secretary GK Pillai as an observer of the BCCI with power to appoint an auditor, and guide the BCCI administration, particularly on the award of contracts and on transparency.

Federer will face Stan Wawrinka in the semi-finals – his 13th trip to the last four in Melbourne in 14 years.Here’s Federer courtside with Jim Courier: “I thought I was maybe going to win a few rounds, maybe get to the fourth round, quarters, depending on the draw. Then when I saw the draw … I didn’t see a dream draw at all. I didn’t expect to play this well. “Stan is a clutch player. He’s won a slam the last three years. I’ve just got to stay aggressive, the more time I give him the better he is.”

Well, that was about as emphatic as you can get. Zverev momentarily looked in the match in the second set but in general he was utterly overwhelmed by Federer, who was imperious.

Third set: Zverev 1-6, 5-7, 2-6 Federer* (*denotes server)An ace takes Federer to 30-0 in a flash but a fine Zverev return brings it back to 30-15 and Federer nets a forehand for 30-30. He follows that up by netting a routine volley. Zverev has an unlikely break point … and Federer crunches down an ace. Match point arrives presently and a forehand into the open court gives Federer victory.

Zverev twice volleys beautifully to save it though. But the German can’t get over the line and nets another volley to bring up a fifth deuce. Federer passes him to bring up a second break point … but an ace saves the day. Deuce No6. He misses with a volley … break point No3. But another fine serve comes to the rescue again. Deuce No7. And then deuce No8. Break point No4 … but Federer goes a touch long. Deuce No9. Federer is almost inside the service box on Zverev’s second serve as he earns a fifth break point … but another ace booms down.Crikey. Deuce No10. Zverev nets a forehand volley.

Third set: *Zverev 1-6, 5-7, 2-3 Federer (*denotes server)Zverev goes 30-0 up but is again passed twice at the net – at times he looks like a man at a bus stop watching perplexed and stranded as the No91 zooms past him without stopping – as Federer brings us back to 30-30. Federer soon has a break point but Zverev scrambles to bring up deuce. Zverev takes the advantage but then there’s probably the rally of the match, Federer brilliantly hitting two lobs, the first of which is hoiked back in by Zverev; the second, a dozen shots later, drops inside the line to give Federer the point. And that puts a bit of a pep into the Swiss – a fizzing cross court backhand gives him another break point, one he takes with a ludicrously good backhand down the line. Zverev, at the net on both occasions, can only watch on with admiration.

Federer brings up 30-30 with two passing shots as Zverev looks on helplessly at the net but a nice deep volley from the next points takes him to 40-30 and Federer goes long from the next.

A wonderful volley from the German keeps him in it at 40-30 but he follows that up with an errant return and Federer leads two sets to love.

Second set: *Zverev 1-6, 5-6 Federer (*denotes server)This is exactly the point that you’d expect Federer to crank through the gears and he duly does so. At 0-15 Federer sends a return skidding onto Zverev’s toes and the big man can only dump the ball into the net. 0-30. And that soon becomes 0-40 as Federer gets the better of a close-quarters exchange at the net. Three break points. Federer needs just won, passing Zverev with ease as the German’s volley sits up to be hit. Federer will serve for the second set.

4.14am EST
04:14

Second set: Zverev 1-6, 5-5 Federer* (*denotes server)So Federer serves to stay in the second set. Zverev seems content to sit at the back of the court on the Federer serve now, tempting Federer to attack the net. Which he does without success on this occasion – Zverev leads 15-30. A weak return from the German allows Federer to go cross-court for 30-30 a long return makes it 40-30, and an ace gives Federer the hold.

Second set: *Zverev 1-6, 5-4 Federer (*denotes server)At 30-0 Federer misses with the most routine of forehands and an ace brings Zverev a routine hold. The German is still on the back foot in the main but it’s chalk-and-cheese from the first set.

04:08

Second set: Zverev 1-6, 4-4 Federer* (*denotes server)Federer cruises into a 30-0 lead but Zverev battles back to 30-30 with the help of his strangely punched forehand (he almost shovels the balls over the net rather than take a full swing). Again from that point though, Federer takes control.

Second set: Zverev 1-6, 3-3 Federer* (*denotes server)The points here are flying by so quickly it’s hard to keep up. Essentially the shape of the match is as follows – Zverev is at the net; if his approach shot is awkward for Federer then Zverev tends to win the point with a volley; if his approach shot is anything other than excellent then Federer wins with a passing shot or by sending a ferocious drive into the body of his opponent.Federer is also attacking the net on occasion – he does so at 30-0 but is beaten by a fine passing shot, then a long baseline rally – the longest of the match – ends with Federer netting a backhand. From 30-all, though, Federer steps on the accelerator again and holds with ease.

3.58am EST
03:58

Second set: *Zverev 1-6, 3-2 Federer (*denotes server)Federer earns two break points – he can’t beat Zverev with a lob from the first but hammers a backhand at the body of his opponent to take the second. We’re back on serve.

Second set: Zverev 1-6, 3-1 Federer* (*denotes server)We have a match now! Zverev breaks to love. All of a sudden, Federer isn’t getting those easy passing opportunities and on the occasions when the Swiss comes to the net, Zverev is making life very awkward.

3.52am EST
03:52

Second set: *Zverev 1-6, 2-1 Federer (*denotes server)The point of the match comes at 30-0 with Zverev being peppered at the net by Federer but coping admirably and finally winning the point with his third successive volley. A hold to love.

3.51am EST
03:51

Second set: Zverev 1-6, 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server)This is better from Zverev, a cracking forehand down the line takes him 15-30 up on the Federer serve. But a couple of thumping Federer backhands help him back to 40-30 and the deepest of deep forehand just kisses the line to give Federer the hold.

“John, can we get some sort of longitudinal study up and running about sporting arena marriage proposals?” wonders Ian Nicol. “I have a feeling that divorce rates among those who marry after a very public proposal must be higher than the national average. There’s something very odd about the impulse to do it. Evidence sought!”I’d be surprised if there’s never been a study done on the “most successful” place for a marriage proposal. Who knows, maybe Rod Laver Arena has a 100% success rate for happy unions. The pool must be fairly small.

03:44

First set: Zverev 1-6 Federer* (*denotes server)That game ends a run of 18 (at least) straight games for Federer against this opponent. Zverev digs in for 30-30 but another straightforward winner gives Federer his first set point … but he makes a rare error, straying wide on his forehand. An ace and a serve-volley of his own brings Federer the first set. It took just 19 minutes.

3.40am EST
03:40

First set: *Zverev 1-5 Federer (*denotes server)So the underdog can’t compete from the baseline and his serve-volley game is being completely undermined by Federer’s returning. He looked tentative from the off and now he looks shellshocked. Another volley off the frame at the net at least gives him a 15-0 lead this time and, after another Federer pass, an ace takes us to 30-15. Federer fails to return another booming serve but then a Zverev volley goes long – 40-30. But Federer goes long with his return from the next and Zverev is on the board.

3.37am EST

First set: Zverev 0-5 Federer* (*denotes server)Zverev already looks a beaten man. Federer holds to love.

03:35

First set: *Zverev 0-4 Federer (*denotes server)Federer races into a 40-0 lead, with Zverev left helpless at the net by his opponent’s brilliant returning. The German’s second shot is continually a desperate pop into the middle of the court, giving Federer all the time he needs to find the passing shot or a lob. Another break to 15.

3.32am EST
03:32

First set: Zverev 0-3 Federer* (*denotes server)Zverev sprints into a 0-30 lead, courtesy of a slightly fortunate framed-volley at the net. Federer responds with an ace before charging the net himself and forcing Zverev to go long. The baseline rallies are complete one-way traffic – with Zverev pinned to the back of the court Federer rattles through another two points and holds once more.

3.29am EST
03:29

First set: *Zverev 0-2 Federer (*denotes server)A couple of successful serve-volleys take Zverev 30-0 up but he nets the next attempt and Federer passes him with a beautiful backhand to bring up 30-all before pinging a forehand cross court to bring a first break point. And Federer needs no second invitation, putting his return onto Zverev’s toes and then hammering another forehand cross-court past his opponent. An early break.

3.26am EST
03:26

First set: Zverev 0-1 Federer* (*denotes server)Zverev won the toss but opted to receive, interestingly. A couple of spot-on serves give Federer a 30-0 lead before Zverev dumps a backhand into the net. The German comes to the net at 40-0 down but Federer stings his racket with a forehand and it’s a straightforward hold for the Swiss.

The bad news for Zverev: In the last 13 Australian Opens, Federer has reached 12 semi-finals. And on both occasions these players have previously met, Federer has won in straight sets.And on the most recent of those occasions, in Halle in 2013, Federer was a 6-0, 6-0 winner.And the Swiss master has been in superb form in Melbourne, crushing Tomas Berdych in round three and coming through a thrilling five-setter with Kei Nishikori in the last 16.The good news?

247,"The British government must hold a vote in both houses of the Parliament before starting the process of leaving the European Union, the country's Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday. UK Prime Minister Theresa May had earlier promised lawmakers a vote on the outcome of the Brexit talks, but had hoped to trigger the talks without parliamentary approval.","Justices rule by eight to three against government over EU exit, but ministers do not need devolved assemblies’ consent

The government has lost its fast-tracked appeal to the supreme court, forcing ministers to introduce emergency legislation into parliament to authorise the UK’s departure from the EU.In a judgment that sets a far-reaching constitutional precedent and upholds parliamentary sovereignty, the court ruled by a majority of eight justices to three that MPs and peers must give their consent before the government can trigger article 50 and formally initiate Brexit.The decision sets clear limits on the extent of the government’s executive powers. Rights embedded in the law by the 1972 European Communities Act, which took the UK into what was then the European Community, cannot be removed by the government’s prerogative powers, a majority of the justices declared.The eagerly awaited ruling by the largest panel of judges ever assembled in Britain’s highest court routes the protracted Brexit process through parliament, handing over to MPs and peers the authority to sanction the UK’s withdrawal.The supreme court ruled that there was no need for the government to wait for consent from the devolved assemblies in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Although the ruling represents a blow to Theresa May’s intended timetable on Brexit, a Downing Street spokesman said the ruling had not changed the verdict of the British people. “It’s important to remember that parliament backed the referendum by a margin of six to one and has already indicated its support for getting on with the process of exit to the timetable we have set out,” a spokesman said. “We respect the supreme court’s decision, and will set out our next steps to parliament shortly.”The government now has a tight deadline to pass even a short bill through parliament, but it is still possible to meet its article 50 deadline of the end of March. In May’s favour, there is not a large appetite in either the Commons or the Lords to actively block the process. The SNP and Lib Dems are likely to vote against the bill if their amendments are not passed, and some Labour rebels will join them. But Labour has no desire to appear to be trying to prevent the referendum result being honoured. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said his party would not “frustrate the process for invoking article 50” but would seek to amend the government’s bill. Corbyn said: “Labour will seek to amend the article 50 bill to prevent the Conservatives using Brexit to turn Britain into a bargain basement tax haven off the coast of Europe. “Labour will seek to build in the principles of full, tariff-free access to the single market and maintenance of workers’ rights and social and environmental protections. “Labour is demanding a plan from the government to ensure it is accountable to parliament throughout the negotiations and a meaningful vote to ensure the final deal is given parliamentary approval.”The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, confirmed his party would vote against article 50 unless people were given another vote on the final deal.Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon, said the ruling showed the promises made to the Scottish government on devolution were “not worth the paper they were written on”. She said the Scottish parliament would still have an opportunity to vote on whether it consented to the triggering of article 50.The attorney general, Jeremy Wright, said the government was “disappointed” by the supreme court ruling but would comply with it. He said enacting the decision would now be a political and not legal matter and the Brexit secretary, David Davis, would be making a statement to the Commons later on Tuesday.Gina Miller, the investment fund manager who was one of the lead claimants in the challenge, welcomed the ruling, saying: “No prime minister, no government can expect to be unanswerable or unchallenged. Parliament alone is sovereign.” Outside the court, she said MPs would now have the chance to help the government select the best course in Brexit talks. She also spoke of how this “divisive issue of a generation” had led to her and her legal team facing “extraordinary and unwarranted criticism”. The justice secretary, Liz Truss, who faced criticism for not defending the appeal court justices denounced by sections of the media as “enemies of the people” after they ruled against the government, said: “Our independent judiciary is the cornerstone of the rule of law and is vital to our constitution and our freedoms. The reputation of our judiciary is unrivalled the world over, and our supreme court justices are people of integrity and impartiality. “While we may not always agree with judgments, it is a fundamental part of any thriving democracy that legal process is followed. The government has been clear that it will respect the decision of the court.” The president of the supreme court, Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury, delivered a summary of the decision, which has far-reaching constitutional implications.Reading the summary, Neuberger said: “By a majority of eight to three, the supreme court rules that the government cannot trigger article 50 without an act of parliament authorising it to do so.“Section 2 of the 1972 [European Communities] Act provides that, whenever EU institutions make new laws, those new laws become part of UK law. The 1972 act therefore makes EU law an independent source of UK law, until parliament decides otherwise.“Therefore, when the UK withdraws from the EU treaties, a source of UK law will be cut off. Further, certain rights enjoyed by UK citizens will be changed. Therefore, the government cannot trigger article 50 without parliament authorising that course.”Neuberger said: “Any change in the law to give effect to the referendum must be made in the only way permitted by the UK constitution, namely by an act of parliament. To proceed otherwise would be a breach of settled constitutional principles stretching back many centuries.”The eight to three margin of defeat suffered by the government was bigger than ministers had hoped for. They had already conceded in advance that they would probably lose.The three dissenting justices who found for the government were Lords Reed, Carnwath and Hughes. Their judgments say that the European Communities Act did not restrict the government’s use of its prerogative powers and that ministers could withdraw without reference to parliament. The devolved assemblies in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff had argued for a say on the basis of the Sewel convention, which provides for them to be consulted on matters that are “normally” devolved, but they did not win any formal right to participate in the Brexit process.Neuberger said: “On the devolution issues, the court unanimously rules that UK ministers are not legally compelled to consult the devolved legislatures before triggering article 50. The devolution statutes were enacted on the assumption that the UK would be a member of the EU, but they do not require it. Relations with the EU are a matter for the UK government.“The Sewel convention plays an important role in the operation of the UK constitution but the policing of its scope and operation is not a matter for the courts.”Paragraph 122 of the 96-page long judgment makes clear that it is up to MPs and peers to decide what form the bill put before parliament should take. The majority judgment states: “What form such legislation should take is entirely a matter for parliament. But, in the light of a point made in oral argument, it is right to add that the fact that parliament may decide to content itself with a very brief statute is nothing to the point. There is no equivalence between the constitutional importance of a statute, or any other document, and its length or complexity. “A notice under article 50(2) could no doubt be very short indeed, but that would not undermine its momentous significance.”"

249,"Written and composed by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, 'Jana Gana Mana' was officially declared as India?s National Anthem on January 24, 1950. It was first sung on December 27, 1911, in Calcutta (now Kolkata) during a convention of the Indian National Congress. A formal rendition of 'Jana Gana Mana', which is written in Bengali Sanskrit, takes 52 seconds."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowIt is a reflex in every Indian to rise the moment you hear
the pride inducing words from our national anthem, leaving all what one is busy with. Soulful
composition and the evocative lyrics surely move you into the realm of
patriotism, at least momentarily. All of us have sung the national anthem and since school, stood up every time we heard it . But do we know enough about our anthem other than that it was written and composed by Nobel laureate and mystic poet Ravindranath Tagore? Here are some interesting facts about our anthem which you probably were not aware of:1.    The false myth that Jana Gana Mana was written and composed by Tagore to praise George the Fourth, who visited India in 1911.2.    A hoax message spread like wild fire across e-mail, Whatsapp and social media, that UNESCO announced our anthem as the 'Best National Anthem' in the world. UNESCO intervened and denied any such declaration from their end.     3.    The first rendition of the song was during a convention of the Indian National Congress on December 16th, 1911. 'Jana Gana Mana' was performed for the first time in Hamburg on 11th September, 1942. It was only on 24th January 1950 that this song was officially declared as India's national anthem.4.    The musical notations for the English translation of our national anthem were set by Margaret, wife of poet James H. Cousins, who was the principal of Besant Theosophical College.5.    Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose commissioned a free translation of the national anthem from Sanskritized Bengali to Urdu-Hindi. The translation was written by Captain Abid Ali, composed by Captain Ram Singh Thakur and was called Subah Sukh Chain.6.    There is no provision of law which compels anyone to sing the national anthem. It is not considered disrespectful to the nation or to the anthem if a person chooses only to stand up in respectful silence.  7.    Formal rendition of the anthem should take 52 seconds by law, and not 54 seconds.8.    Interestingly, Rabindranath Tagore has written the national anthem of Bangladesh as well.9.    In 2005, many protested and called for deleting the word Sindh and to replace it with the word Kashmir. Argument was that Sindh is now a part of Kashmir.On 7th of July, 2015, Rajasthan Governor, Kalyan Singh has called for replacing the word Adhinayaka with the word Mangal, basing his argument on the myth Tagore himself busted back in 1939 itself.

250,"Women were spotted wearing hijabs made out of the American flag at the Women's March in Washington, DC, held against the new US President Donald Trump. Some non-Muslim women also reportedly wore the flag hijab to the march in a show of support. Ever since his election campaign, Donald Trump said he plans to ban Muslims from entering the US."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe Women's March that followed President Donald Trump's inauguration day, caused a huge furore in its remarkable attempt to herald an end to the beginning of a new era of dictatorship.When women all across the globe and their supporters took to the streets to stand in solidarity against Trump's fascist regime, they garnered empathy indeed but was not bereft of controversy.Some have been sceptical if the march would be an end in itself. Some wonder if this march would rightly pave way to address not just white woman's feminism but the over-all issue of equality and human rights.We cannot certify what this would lead to but, at least, one cannot deny that such a mass uprising is commendable in its very approach of flagging issues that might impact civilisation in general.Among those numerous posters and placards that made news, what caught one's eye are women wearing colourful hijabs. And it is not just any hijab. Take a closer look and you will find they are made out of the American flag.Also Read: Japan threatens India with WTO on steel as Donald Trump era heralds rising tensionsEver since his election campaign days, Trump has posed himself as the new manifest of bigotry, claiming to ban Muslims and other immigrants from the country altogether. The very juxtaposition of the national flag modified into the hijab underlines the message that has driven the march: The President is not America; it is the people in their diversity who constitute America. And the American salad bowl cannot deny religious freedom to any of its residents.The hijab has been fetishized ever since the world blindly started attributing all terrorist activities to a particular community. Earlier, the burkini ban in France and the ban on hijab in Germany had also resulted in a lot of protests. What one should not forget at this point is that the hijab has not only been identified as a religious symbol but has also instigated cultural sexism. For women wearing the hijab have long been subjected to verbal and physical abuse in every corner of the world. The flag hijabs thus seem to stand against marginalisation on two levels- as a Muslim, and also as a brown, Muslim woman.The world is now perhaps in greater need of inclusive uprisings that would extend beyond the white woman's umbrella to embrace a broader perspective of feminism. #WomensMarch : le hijab, nouvel tendard fministe ?A lire sur Bellica : https://t.co/QRoU5Y890N pic.twitter.com/wNDCHmhqrg Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

He was caught by Dhruv Raval.Middle-order batsmen Karun Nair (7) and Manoj Tiwary (7) also failed to step up to the occasion as both were dismissed cheaply by Hardik Patel and Mohit Thadani.Incoming batsman Saha, who marked his return from injury with a gritty hundred then stabilised the innings with the skipper to put his team back into the match.

Tom DartThe Guardian’s Tom Dart reports from Bellville, Texas:Business was brisk in the Trump Cafe, a Donald-themed diner in the small Texas town of Bellville, an hour’s drive from Houston. Patrons cheered the president’s inauguration and clapped during moments in his speech when patriotism and promises united in rhetorical embrace. Larry Reed sat at the entrance behind a table selling hats, flasks, wristbands and Trump badges with the slogan “Make America Great Again, President, Commander in Chief, Tweet Softly - But Carry A Big Stick.”“I think that we’ve needed change in this country for a long, long time, and that’s why he got elected,” the 72-year-old said. “Middle America, everything other than a couple of coastal areas has been crying out for change and neither party has given it. And it’s time. And so they took someone with a little populism and said ‘hey, you know what? He doesn’t have to be perfect. If he claims to do these things, and he does it, we’re going to be happy’.”Reed does not think electing Trump is risky. “No president can bring this country down, okay? Every president has had flaws, deep flaws, every one of them. They’re just men. But if they will lead, if they will put the right people in place to implement things that we need to see, we’ll be fine. We always are, no matter who the president is, and that’s what everyone has to realise this year. We’re going to be just fine if everybody will just zip their lips and watch it happen.”

Here’s the text of Trump’s inauguration speech, as prepared for delivery:Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you.We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People.For too long, a small group in our nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.Washington flourished – but the people did not share in its wealth.Politicians prospered – but the jobs left, and the factories closed.The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.That all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration.And this, the United States of America, is your country.What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.Everyone is listening to you now.You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.We are one nation – and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;We’ve defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own;And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.From this moment on, it’s going to be America First.Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.I will fight for you with every breath in my body – and I will never, ever let you down.America will start winning again, winning like never before.We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.We will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.The Bible tells us, “how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.”We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.There should be no fear – we are protected, and we will always be protected.We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.The time for empty talk is over.Now arrives the hour of action.Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:You will never be ignored again.Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God Bless America.

Theresa May will not remain in power long as Brexit cripples her government, while Donald Trump is a “would-be dictator” who is “going to fail”, the billionaire investor George Soros has told the Davos world economic forum.On the eve of Trump’s inauguration as president, Soros delivered a scathing assessment, saying the “impostor and con-man” was “gearing up for a trade war” which would have “a very far-reaching effect in Europe and other parts of the world”.The “would-be-dictator … didn’t expect to win, he was surprised”, Soros told an audience of business leaders and journalists in Davos where the World Economic Forum is being held.“I personally have confidence that he’s going to fail … because his ideas that guide him are inherently self-contradictory,” added Soros, who was a supporter of Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during the 2016 US presidential election campaign.Soros said he expected financial markets to “not do very well” because of the uncertainty generated by the Trump administration.On Theresa May and Brexit, Soros predicted economic upheaval in Britain and substantial difficulties in bringing about a clean break with the European Union – and the prospect of the UK quickly joining again or entering a successor arrangement once the referendum mandate of leaving the EU was fulfilled.“In my opinion it is unlikely that prime minister May is actually going to remain in power. Already she has a very divided cabinet, a very small majority in parliament. And I think she will not last,” he said.“At the moment the people in the UK are in denial. The current economic situation is not as bad as was predicted and they live in hope. But as the currency depreciates, and inflation will be the driving force, this will lead to declining living standards.“This is going to take some time, but when it does happen they’ll realise that they are earning less than before because wages won’t rise as fast as the cost of living.“The divorce is going to take a very long time. It’s much harder to divorce than to get married, so I think the desire for rapprochement will develop, and in theory or maybe even in practice you could have a situation in 2019 or 2020 when Britain will leave the EU, because it does have to take place, but they could leave on a Friday but join over the weekend and have the new arrangement in place in Monday morning.”Soros said he hoped both sides would realise they must find some common ground and find common ground to avoid a bitter divorce.The future for Europe looked bleak, Soros said, after a disastrous 2016. Europe had become too complicated, leaving people alienated and anti-European parties gathering force.May, speaking earlier at the forum, said Britain had voted with “determination and quiet resolve” to leave the EU but it was “overwhelmingly” in Britain’s interests for Europe to succeed.“Britain must face up to a period of momentous change. It means we must go through a tough negotiation and forge a new role for ourselves in the world. It means accepting that the road ahead will be uncertain at times, but believing that it leads towards a brighter future for our country’s children, and grandchildren too.“We are going to be a confident country that is in control of its destiny once again.”With the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse"

The man suspected of shooting dead 39 people in a New Year’s Eve attack on a nightclub in Istanbul has been arrested, Turkish officials said late last night.It is understood the Uzbek national, named as Abdulkadir Masharipov by the Turkish media, was captured in a raid by security forces on a house in the residential Esenyurt district of Istanbul, 25 miles from where the attack took place.A state news agency also reported that four other people were arrested with him, including a Kyrgyz man and three women.The state-run Anadolu Agency said the suspects were being taken to Istanbul’s police headquarters for questioning. It also claimed police were carrying out raids on other suspected Islamic State cells.After the arrest, Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, thanked police and security organisations “who caught the Reina attacker in the name of the people”.In the last two weeks, dozens of people across Turkey have been detained and questioned in connection with the deadly assault at the Reina nightclub.During the attack on new year revellers, the gunman arrived by taxi at the upmarket venue in the Ortaköy district on 31 December and shot dead 21-year-old police officer Burak Yıldız and Ayhan Arık, a 47-year-old travel agent who had been walking past the entrance.He then went inside and started spraying bullets at the 600 partygoers. The attacker repeatedly reloaded his weapon to shoot the wounded as they lay on the ground. At least 70 people were injured.Isis has claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was revenge for Turkish military involvement in Syria.After fleeing the scene of the massacre, it is believed the gunman initially hid in a safe house, where he was joined by his wife and children. He then fled with his four-year-old son, who was still with him when he was pinned down by officers and handcuffed, according to the Turkish newspaper Hürriyet. A photograph circulated on social media by the publication shows a bruised and bloodied black-haired man.The Turkish television channel NTV said the suspect’s son had been taken into protective custody. It said police had established the gunman’s whereabouts four or five days ago, but delayed the raid to monitor his movements and contacts.Before the arrest, Turkey’s deputy prime minister said he believed the attack had been carried out professionally and an intelligence organisation was involved.During an interview with broadcaster A Haber on Monday, Norman Kurtulmus said: “It was an extremely planned and organised attack.”"

The world’s eight richest billionaires control the same wealth between them as the poorest half of the globe’s population, according to a charity warning of an ever-increasing and dangerous concentration of wealth.In a report published to coincide with the start of the week-long World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Oxfam said it was “beyond grotesque” that a handful of rich men headed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates are worth $426bn (£350bn), equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion people.The development charity called for a new economic model to reverse an inequality trend that it said helped to explain Brexit and Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election.Oxfam blamed rising inequality on aggressive wage restraint, tax dodging and the squeezing of producers by companies, adding that businesses were too focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives.The World Economic Forum (WEF) said last week that rising inequality and social polarisation posed two of the biggest risks to the global economy in 2017 and could result in the rolling back of globalisation.Oxfam said the world’s poorest 50% owned the same in assets as the $426bn owned by a group headed by Gates, Amancio Ortega, the founder of the Spanish fashion chain Zara, and Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway.The others are Carlos Slim Helú: the Mexican telecoms tycoon and owner of conglomerate Grupo Carso; Jeff Bezos: the founder of Amazon; Mark Zuckerberg: the founder of Facebook; Larry Ellison, chief executive of US tech firm Oracle; and Michael Bloomberg; a former mayor of New York and founder and owner of the Bloomberg news and financial information service.Last year, Oxfam said the world’s 62 richest billionaires were as wealthy as half the world’s population. However, the number has dropped to eight in 2017 because new information shows that poverty in China and India is worse than previously thought, making the bottom 50% even worse off and widening the gap between rich and poor.With members of the forum due to arrive on Monday in Switzerland, where guests will range from the Chinese president Xi Jinping, to pop star Shakira, the WEF released its own inclusive growth and development report in which it said median income had fallen by an average of 2.4% between 2008 and 2013 across 26 advanced nations.Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Iceland and Denmark filled the top five places in the WEF’s inclusive development index, with Britain 21st and the US 23rd. The body that organises the Davos event said rising inequality was not an “iron law of capitalism”, but a matter of making the right policy choices.The WEF report found that 51% of the 103 countries for which data was available saw their inclusive development index scores decline over the past five years, “attesting to the legitimacy of public concern and the challenge facing policymakers regarding the difficulty of translating economic growth into broad social progress”.Basing its research on the Forbes rich list and data provided by investment bank Credit Suisse, Oxfam said the vast majority of people in the bottom half of the world’s population were facing a daily struggle to survive, with 70% of them living in low-income countries. It was four years since the WEF had first identified inequality as a threat to social stability, but that the gap between rich and poor has continued to widen, Oxfam added.“From Brexit to the success of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, a worrying rise in racism and the widespread disillusionment with mainstream politics, there are increasing signs that more and more people in rich countries are no longer willing to tolerate the status quo,” the report said.The charity said new information had shown that poor people in China and India owned even fewer assets than previously thought, making the wealth gap more pronounced than it thought a year ago, when it announced that 62 billionaires owned the same wealth as the poorest half of the global population.Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, said: “This year’s snapshot of inequality is clearer, more accurate and more shocking than ever before. It is beyond grotesque that a group of men who could easily fit in a single golf buggy own more than the poorest half of humanity. “While one in nine people on the planet will go to bed hungry tonight, a small handful of billionaires have so much wealth they would need several lifetimes to spend it. The fact that a super-rich elite are able to prosper at the expense of the rest of us at home and overseas shows how warped our economy has become.”Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, said: “Once again Oxfam have come out with a report that demonises capitalism, conveniently skimming over the fact that free markets have helped over 100 million people rise out of poverty in the last year alone.”The Oxfam report added that since 2015 the richest 1% has owned more wealth than the rest of the planet. It said that over the next 20 years, 500 people will hand over $2.1tn to their heirs – a sum larger than the annual GDP of India, a country with 1.3 billion people. Between 1988 and 2011 the incomes of the poorest 10% increased by just $65, while the incomes of the richest 1% grew by $11,800 – 182 times as much.Oxfam called for fundamental change to ensure that economies worked for everyone, not just “a privileged few”.

It also found that over 91% of the coral is at least partly bleached. A survey in September and October discovered that over 56% of the reef had died, meaning the bleaching has spread rapidly. ","Coral in the Sekisei lagoon in Okinawa has turned brown and is covered with algae, according to a government studyAlmost three-quarters of Japan’s biggest coral reef has died, according to a report that blames its demise on rising sea temperatures caused by global warming.The Japanese environment ministry said that 70% of the Sekisei lagoon in Okinawa had been killed by a phenomenon known as bleaching.Bleaching occurs when unusually warm water causes coral to expel the algae living in their tissues, causing the coral to turn completely white. Unless water temperatures quickly return to normal, the coral eventually dies from lack of nutrition.The plight of the reef, located in Japan’s southernmost reaches, has become “extremely serious” in recent years, according to the ministry, whose survey of 35 locations in the lagoon last November and December found that 70.1% percent of the coral had died.The dead coral has now turned dark brown and is now covered with algae, the Yomiuri Shimbun said.The newspaper said the average sea surface temperature between last June and August in the southern part of the Okinawa island chain was 30.1 degrees centigrade – or one to two degrees warmer than usual – and the highest average temperature since records began in 1982, according to the Japan meteorological agency.The ministry report follows warnings by the Coral Reef Watch programme at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that global coral bleaching could become the “new normal” due to warming oceans.Experts said that bleaching had spread to about 90% of the Sekisei reef, a popular diving spot that covers 400sq km.A similar survey conducted in September and October last year found that just over 56% of the reef had died, indicating that bleaching has spread rapidly in recent months."

Floyd Mayweather has said he will come out of retirement to fight Conor McGregor but only if he gets paid $100m (£82m) and the Irish UFC star is prepared to take a career-high $15m (£12m), plus a minor slice of the pay-per-view revenue.Meanwhile, the 38-year-old Manny Pacquiao, who had been hoping for a rematch with Mayweather, has agreed to defend his WBO welterweight title against a little-known Queensland schoolteacher, Jeff Horn, in Brisbane in April, according to unconfirmed reports in Australia. It is part of a three-fight farewell Pacquiao’s promoter, Bob Arum, is organising for the Filipino senator.It is the Mayweather-McGregor fight that would create the substantially bigger buzz, however, which says much about the state of boxing and the rise of mixed martial arts. Regardless of the fact it would be a mismatch, it still might be the richest fight in either fighting discipline in 2017.Mayweather, who turns 40 next month and retired undefeated in September 2015, has teased his fans for months with the prospect of having one more fight to surpass the 49-0 record that he currently shares with Rocky Marciano.In an exclusive interview with ESPN, the American said: “I’m saying right here: Conor McGregor keeps telling everybody he wants the fight – let’s make it happen.“We tried to make the fight. They know what my number is. My number was a guaranteed $100m. We’re the A-side and I don’t know how much money he has made? I’m pretty sure he hasn’t even made $10m from an MMA bout. But we are willing to give him $15m and then we can talk about splitting the percentage, the back-end percentage on pay-per view.“But of course we’re the A-side. How can a guy talk about $20m or $30m if he’s never even made $8m or $9m [for one fight]?”In his penultimate appearance in May 2015, Mayweather split a record $340m purse 60/40 with Pacquiao and boosted his take to an estimated $300m with his share of the pay-per-view. However, the cachet of both champions has faded and Mayweather has little or no interest in a rematch. Given the reaction to a bout that inevitably disappointed after serial postponements over five years, neither is there a great hunger for it among boxing fans.“The only thing I’m probably interested in,” Mayweather added, “is the Conor McGregor fight. I’m a businessman, and it makes more business sense.”McGregor, who recently acquired a boxing licence in California, has yet to respond.• This article was amended on 12 January 2017.

302,"US-based researchers have identified that the human appendix, which is often viewed as a vestigial organ with little-known use, may serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria. Mammals with an appendix were found to have higher concentrations of lymphoid tissue in the cecum, a pouch from which the appendix develops, suggesting that appendix serves as a secondary immune organ."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowWashington, Jan 10 (PTI) The human appendix, which is thought to be of little use to the body, may actually serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria, a new study has found.The appendix, a narrow pouch that projects off the cecum in the digestive system, has a notorious reputation for its tendency to become inflamed (appendicitis), often resulting in surgical removal.Although it is widely viewed as a vestigial organ with little known function, the new study suggests that the appendix may serve an important purpose.In particular, it may serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria.Several other mammal species also have an appendix and studying how it evolved and functions in these species may shed light on this mysterious organ in humans.Researchers from the Midwestern University Arizona College of Osteopathic Medicine in the US gathered data on the presence or absence of the appendix and other gastrointestinal and environmental traits for 533 mammal species.They mapped the data onto a phylogeny (genetic tree) to track how the appendix has evolved through mammalian evolution, and to try to determine why some species have an appendix while others do not.They discovered that the appendix has evolved independently in several mammal lineages, over 30 separate times, and almost never disappears from a lineage once it has appeared. This suggests that the appendix likely serves an adaptive purpose.Looking at ecological factors, such as diet, climate, how social a species is, and where it lives, they were able to reject several previously proposed hypotheses that have attempted to link the appendix to dietary or environmental factors.Instead, they found that species with an appendix have higher average concentrations of lymphoid (immune) tissue in the cecum.This finding suggests that the appendix may play an important role as a secondary immune organ.Lymphatic tissue can also stimulate growth of some types of beneficial gut bacteria, providing further evidence that the appendix may serve as a ""safe house"" for helpful gut bacteria.They also found that animals with certain shaped ceca (tapering or spiral-shaped) were more likely to have an appendix than animals with a round or cylindrical cecum.Therefore, they concluded that the appendix is not evolving independently, but as part of a larger ""cecoappendicular complex"" including both the appendix and cecum.

They write the brand names instead of the generic names, knowingly favouring certain companies.Some media reports said there is a tacit understanding between these doctors and the pharmaceutical companies.

The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, has robustly defended the decision to expand the World Cup from 32 competing national teams to 48, which will begin with the 2026 tournament, in the face of immediate criticism from top European clubs. At a meeting in Zurich, Fifa’s rule-making council unanimously passed the new format, which will create a first round of 16 groups, from which two of three teams will qualify and proceed to a knockout competition beginning with 32 countries.Fifa has projected that the increase to 48 countries will generate around $1bn more income, and $640m profit, from greater television rights and sponsorship. Infantino said the money will be reinvested in football; he has promised all Fifa’s 211 member countries’ associations $5m a year to aid development.From 2026 the World Cup will be contested by 48 teams rather than the current 32. In justifying the change, Fifa president Gianni Infantino said 135 of Fifa's 211 members had never qualified for the tournament and that more countries would now have the ""chance to dream"". This means the first round will have 16 groups of three teams, with the top two qualifying for the knockout phase. The new-look tournament will increase the number of matches from 64 to 80, but Infantino said it would require the same number of match days and stadiums as now.Speaking after the meeting, Infantino argued that the expanded tournament will increase interest in football worldwide by involving more countries, while not burdening players with more matches.Responding robustly to criticism from the German football association (DFB) and European Club Association (ECA), which derided Fifa’s decision as having been taken for “political reasons rather than sporting ones,” Infantino said: “We are in the 21st century, and we should shape the World Cup for the 21st century. Football is more than Europe and South America; football is global.”Fifa’s football associations, particularly in Africa and Asia, have historically been in favour of the tournament’s expansion, which Infantino said will give them all more places in the finals. Precise numbers are yet to be decided, as are some of the format’s details, including whether drawn first-round group matches could all be decided on penalties. The host for the 2026 tournament is due to be considered in 2020, with a bid featuring the US, either on its own or in conjunction with one or both of Canada and Mexico, the overwhelming favourite.Arguing that qualification for the World Cup provides a key boost to football development in smaller countries, Infantino pointed to the advances of Iceland, Wales and Hungary in last year’s European Championship as examples of “beautiful stories”. European football’s governing body, Uefa, decided in 2008 to expand its tournament from 16 countries to 24, and Europe’s representatives on Fifa’s council supported the World Cup increase, despite the opposition from leading clubs.In a statement the ECA, which has 220 member clubs in 53 European countries, said that the 32 team format is “a perfect formula” and suggested that Infantino had in mind electoral support from Fifa’s member associations, which each vote for for the president. Questioning the “urgency” with which so historic a decision was taken, less than a year since Infantino was elected, the ECA said “stakeholders” who will be “impacted” had not been properly involved.“We understand that this decision has been taken based on political reasons rather than sporting ones and under considerable political pressure, something ECA believes is regrettable,” the statement said.Infantino declined to respond to reports immediately after Fifa’s announcement that the Spanish football league, La Liga, which claimed it was not consulted at all, is considering a lawsuit. Last week the DFB president, Reinhard Grindel, expressed “immense reservations” about the proposed expansion, arguing that allowing 16 more countries to qualify would reduce the quality of the football.Referring to his election last February on a proposal to expand the World Cup to 40 teams, Infantino said the prime objection from European clubs had been to increasing the number of matches played, and the tournament’s length. He said Fifa administrators had since examined four different formats and found that the 48-team expansion could address those concerns.The immediate move to a 32-team knockout competition after the two matches played by each country in the first round of 16 groups, means the finalists will have played seven games, the same as in the current format. The tournament can still be played over 32 days, as it is now. Infantino pointed out that Uefa’s expansion lengthened the European Championship by a week, and incorporated one more match for the finalists.Arguing that the quality of football is improving around the world, and pointing to the elimination of both England and Italy by Costa Rica in the last World Cup in 2014, Infantino said: “Increasing the size of teams which can participate will increase the investment in football development, to make sure that the teams can qualify.”The FA’s chief executive, Martin Glenn, had said his preference was “to keep the tournament smaller,” but he acknowledged that “smaller countries understandably want to be part of the tournament.” The English representative on the Fifa council, David Gill, did not attend the meeting because of a previously arranged visit to Australia, but given the strength of support for the expansion, he had been expected to vote in favour.In a statement after the decision, the FA said: “We will work with Uefa, Fifa and the other European associations to understand how the 48-team Fifa World Cup will work. The priority has to be consideration of the potential impact on fans, players, teams and leagues, and also recognition of the importance of sporting integrity and commercial viability.”"

"," Jump to navigationSpeak NowIf tourism in Maharashtra has been progressive, this new development will mark another milestone in boosting the industry. The state now has 12 new coastal tourist locations, identified through a project funded by United Nations and the Centre.These new tourists sites have been identified along the 121 km coast of Sindhudurg, as part of the efforts to reduce excessive tourist traffic in the region. So far, majority of the tourist activities were concentrated in the Malvan area of the district which in turn were impacting marine life adversely.The new locations,within 10 kms from the coast, were scouted with fundings from United Nations Development Programme and the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, and an interim report submitted to the state on October 30, 2016.Also Read: Emerald Blue and You: A tour around the paradise that Andaman isWhile this new move echoes the world-wide thrust on Responsible Tourism, the state is also banking on the clear waters and marine life as the USP to attract more number of arrivals to the region.

Near Vengurla, there is a very high diversity in fish, which includes rare predator fish,"" Chief Conservator of Forest (CCF) N Vasudevanwas quoted saying by The Indian Express. Besides, these new sites will also offer various sea water activities like scuba diving and snorkelling to further divert tourist pressure from Malvan.Local residents too will be having their fair share of impact of this strategy. A report prepared on these lines anticipate employment generation for close to 3000 people in various capacities. The first batch of people in Sindhudurg, who were affiliated with the state, were reportedly earning at least Rs 40,000.Sindhudurg recorded around 13 lakh tourist arrivals last year owing to the affordability and variety of water sports that the region offers.   Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

Benjamin LeeIt’s here! That Hollywood awards show that isn’t the Oscars! The Golden Globes, often seen as the slightly less highbrow cousin of the Academy awards, is actually a lot more fun. It eschews many of the drier categories (no best use of a pause or smoothest transition here!) and allows the many starry attendees to get drunk throughout.Typically, the host has always been a bit looser too so we’ve enjoyed Amy Poehler and Tina Fey casually eviscerate A-listers and Ricky Gervais ensure that he receives zero LA-stamped Christmas cards forever more. This year, we have the slightly safer option of Jimmy Fallon but he’s already promised Trump jokes and, let’s face it, he owes us an electoral college worth of them after he televised the pair’s sleepover last year.It’s also a promising crop up for awards this year, a slightly fresher pack than usual with La La Land, Moonlight and Manchester by the Sea leading the film side and The Crown, The Night Manager and The People vs OJ Simpson making a strong showing.But who will win? Who will lose? Who will mispronounce a nominee’s name and go viral? We’ll be here with you all damn night providing answers and probably some yawns too. Stick with us!"

328,"According to a recent European study, diesel cars are 10 times more toxic than diesel trucks and buses due to stricter European Union testing standards applied to larger vehicles. Nitrogen oxide emissions per kilometre for diesel cars were found to be double that of heavy-duty vehicles. Diesel cars emit about six times more toxic gases than allowed, the study claimed.","Stricter EU emissions testing for large vehicles means modern diesel cars produce 10 times more NOx per litre of fuel

Modern diesel cars produce 10 times more toxic air pollution than heavy trucks and buses, new European data has revealed.The stark difference in emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) is due to the much stricter testing applied to large vehicles in the EU, according to the researchers behind a new report. They say the same strict measures must be applied to cars.NOx pollution is responsible for tens of thousands of early deaths across Europe, with the UK suffering a particularly high toll. Much of the pollution is produced by diesel cars, which on the road emit about six times more than allowed in the official lab-based tests. Following the Volkswagen “dieselgate” scandal, the car tests are due to be toughened, but campaigners say the reforms do not go far enough.The new report from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), a research group that played a key role in exposing Volkswagen’s cheating, compared the emissions from trucks and buses in realistic driving conditions with those of cars.It found that heavy-duty vehicles tested in Germany and Finland emitted about 210mg NOx per kilometre driven, less than half the 500mg/km pumped out by modern diesel cars that meet the highest “Euro 6” standard. However, the buses and trucks have larger engines and burn more diesel per kilometre, meaning that cars produce 10 times more NOx per litre of fuel.The ICCT analysis showed that manufacturers were able to ensure that heavy duty vehicles kept below pollution limits when on the road, but that emissions from cars soar once in the real world.Official EU tests for cars are currently limited to laboratory measurements of prototype vehicles. “In contrast, for measurement of NOx emissions from trucks and buses, mobile testing devices became mandatory in 2013. As a consequence, randomly selected vehicles can be tested under real-world driving conditions,” said Peter Mock, managing director of ICCT in Europe.Changes to the car testing regime in the EU are due to start in September, with mobile devices, called portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS), attached to vehicles as they drive on real roads. But Mock warned: “Manufacturers will still be allowed to carefully select special prototype cars for emissions testing. Instead, it would be much better to measure the emissions of ordinary mass-production vehicles, obtained from customers who have had been driving them in an ordinary way.” Such a system is used in the US where the dieselgate scandal first emerged. It will also be put forward for discussion by the European commission on 17 January in Brussels, but the ICCT said it faces resistance from some vehicle manufacturers and EU member states.In December, the European commission started legal action against the UK and six other EU states for failing to act against car emissions cheating in the wake of the dieselgate scandal. But later the same month, a draft European parliament inquiry found the European commission itself guilty of maladministration for failing to act quickly enough on evidence that defeat devices were being used to game emissions tests.Evidence that some diesel cars emitted up to four times more NOx pollution than a bus was revealed in 2015. Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP and a lead negotiator on the EU’s air quality law, said “It is disgraceful that car manufacturers have failed to reduce deadly emissions when the technology to do so is affordable and readily available. The dramatic reduction in NOx emissions from heavier vehicles is a result of far stricter EU tests, in place since 2011, that reflect real-world driving conditions. If buses and trucks can comply with these limits, there’s no reason cars can’t as well.”• The headline on this article was amended on 19 January 2017 to more precisely reflect the details of the article."

What started as an Instagram row has escalated to such an extent that the greatest pound-for-pound boxer of his generation has become involved in the beef between R&B stars Chris Brown and Soulja Boy.Floyd Mayweather, who was undefeated in his 49 fights, winning world titles at super featherweight, lightweight, light welterweight, welterweight and light middleweight, is to train Soulja Boy for a three-round bout with Brown, to take place in Las Vegas in March.The dispute began on Tuesday, when Brown took exception to Soulja Boy liking an Instagram photo posted by Brown’s former girlfriend, Karrueche Tran. The two stars began posting threatening Instagram videos directed at each other, as well as mocking tweets. Soon, Brown challenged Soulja Boy to a fight, and his offer was accepted.Though Soulja Boy posted a remorseful video in which he said he hoped to work with Brown, he also tweeted a message involving Brown’s infant daughter, to which Brown responded furiously in a video, saying: “We gonna set up this fight, it’s gonna be professional, you can do all of that. But one thing you gotta stop doing my nigga, I’m gonna be real with you: stop bringing my daughter into this my nigga. Stop saying shit about my fucking daughter.” The fight became a reality on Thursday, when Mayweather – who is now a boxing promoter – posted an image on his Instagram plugging the fight as “Mayweather Promotions Presents … celebrity boxing live on pay-per-view”. Soulja Boy reposted the image, adding: “Signed my contract I’m leaving the fight with $1,000,000 I got the best ever my big bro @floydmayweather training me damn … March in Vegas!! On TV.”He followed that with a video of him and Mayweather, with the former boxer saying, “We gotta get the money” and Soulja Boy responding: “The biggest fight of the century.”"

A 105-year-old man has made history by cycling more than 14 miles round a track in an hour.Robert Marchand set the first hour record in the over-100s category in 2012, then beat it himself two years later at the age of 102, when he covered more than 16 miles. While his distance in Wednesday’s ride was not as great as those two, the new over-105s category had been specially created for him to reflect the magnitude of his feat.Cheered by hundreds of fans, the Frenchman completed 92 laps round the velodrome at Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, near Paris.“I did not see the sign warning me I had 10 minutes left,” said Marchand. “Otherwise I would have gone faster, I would have posted a better time. I’m now waiting for a rival.” Marchand’s fans chanted “Robert, Robert” as he neared the end of the ride and gave him a standing ovation at its conclusion, before he was mobbed by TV crews.“He could have been faster but he made a big mistake. He has stopped eating meat over the past month after being shocked by recent reports on how animals are subjected to cruel treatment,” his physiologist, Veronique Billat, told the Associated Press.Marchand was born in Amiens, near the frontline of the first world war, three years before its outbreak. He worked as a firefighter in later life, before going to live in Venezuela and Canada.Back in France in the 1960s, Marchand made a living through various jobs that left him with no time to practise sports. He was 68 when he began a series of cycling feats.While Marchand is not making plans for the future, his coach, Gerard Mistler, said he would not be surprised to see him continue cycling. “Setting goals for himself is part of his personality,” he said. “If he tells me he wants to improve his record, I’ll be game. Robert is a great example for all of us.” "

The new 12-sided £1 coin will enter circulation on 28 March and the old-style coin will be defunct by mid-October, the Treasury has announced.The government is launching a campaign to encourage the public to return the round coins. The Treasury estimates that £1.3bn of coins are being stored in savings jars, with £1 coins accounting for almost a third of these. They must be exchanged before 15 October when they will cease to be legal tender.The first new £1 coin since 1983 is an attempt to end counterfeiting. It is estimated that 3% of the current coins in circulation are fake. The new coin will be the most secure in the world, it is claimed, with several security features, including a hologram.David Gauke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “28 March should be an important date in everybody’s calendar – as we will have a new quid on the block. Our message is clear: if you have a round £1 coin you need to spend it or return it to your bank before 15 October.”About 40% of vending and other cash-receiving machines will have to be upgraded. The British Parking Association says each meter change will cost £90-£130 for the simplest software upgrade and considerably more if they are to issue change. The Royal Mint has put the cost of changing all the UK’s machines at £15m-£20m, although many experts believe this is optimistic.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said she believed businesses would be ready. “While there will be a natural transition period where some vending systems may only be able to accept the existing coin, our industry is committed to ensuring we’re fully prepared ahead of the launch.”The Royal Mint has produced more than 2.2bn round £1 coins since 1983, when it replaced the note. This was withdrawn in March 1988, but is still redeemable at the Bank of England.The Royal Mint will make more than 1.5bn of the new coins, whose design is based on the threepenny bit, which went out of circulation in 1971."

Paralympian Deepa Malik, wrestler Sakshi Malik and Paralympian Devendra Jhajharia completed the list of athletes.Let's take a look at what these six sports stars achieved in 2016.VIRAT KOHLI (44.18%)Virat Kohli surely made 2016 a year to remember.

The eight five-fors and three 10-wicket hauls in this year's Test matches placed him at the cusp of being quickest bowler to 250 Test wickets. His performances helped him bag the ICC Test Cricketer of the Year award and the Sir Garfield Sobers trophy for the Cricketer of the Year in 2016.DEEPA MALIK (4.05%)Paralympian Deepa Malik bagged the Silver medal  in the Women's Shot Put F53 event at the 2016 Rio Paralympics Games, clinching the medal with a personal best throw of 4.61 meters.

In 2015, the Rajasthan government had provided 5% reservation for  Gujjars, Banjaras, Gadia Lohars, Gadarias and Raikas under Special Backward Classes, taking the total reservation in Rajasthan to 54%. However, the Rajasthan High Court struck down the move."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakashan Sangharsh Samiti has begun to
demand that a separate reservation of 5 per cent be created for the
nomadic castes within the OBC quota, thus abiding
with the total cap of 50 per cent on reservation.The Gujjars demand for reservation in Rajasthan can fast become an albatross around Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje's neck. After the Rajasthan High Court struck down the move to bring five castes, including Gujjars, under the Special Backward Castes (SBC) category, the Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakashan Sangharsh Samiti has begun to demand that a separate reservation of 5 per cent be created for the nomadic castes within the Other Backward Classes (OBC), thus abiding with the total cap of 50 per cent on reservation.This, the agitating Gujjars feel, can help avoid the court's scrutiny.The Rajasthan government had, through a Bill in September, 2015, provided 5 per cent reservation for 5 castes under the Special Backward Classes (SBC), thus taking the total reservation in Rajasthan to 54 per cent. These castes include Gujjars, Banjaras, Gadia Lohars, Gadarias and Raikas.RAJASTHAN GOVERNMENT IN DILEMMA OVER DEMANDThe Rajasthan government is presently in a dilemma about whether it must accept the demand. If it yields, it runs the risk of antagonising other castes whose share in the reservation quota will then drop. Such castes include the Jats and Bishnois, among many others.Currently, according to the Supreme Court, the cap on reservation under different categories in government jobs is 50 per cent. Before the government decided to bring in a Bill for 5 per cent reservation in September last year, caste-based reservation in government jobs in Rajasthan stood at 49 per cent. That included 21 per cent for OBCs, 16 per cent for Scheduled Castes and 12 per cent for Scheduled Tribes.Also read | Raj Govt tries to assure Gujjars on quota after stir threatThe High Court had mentioned that five castes (Gujjars, Banjaras, Gadarias, Raikas and Gadia Lohars), previously falling in the category of OBCs and getting benefits of reservation, have been brought under SBCs to provide five per cent reservation, exceeding the ceiling of 50 per cent.The court observed that the SBC Commission and the state government had failed to discharge their obligation, as per the directions of the apex court, to collect quantifiable data.The court, citing the Supreme Court's 9-judge bench Indira Sahani judgement, stated that there were no special reasons for creating a separate 5 per cent reservation pool for these castes. The court mentioned that according to a report, there were 25 more backward castes.GUJJARS FEEL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT KEPT PROMISEThe representative Gujjars, who have witnessed several violent agitations in the past, feel that the government has so far not fulfilled its promise of ensuring Amendment to the 9th Schedule to bring in the requisite changes. In May 2015, members of the Gujjar community began agitating in Bharatpur by once again blocking railway tracks. After that, representatives of the Sangharsh Samiti were called in for a dialogue.As per Himmat Singh Gujjar, spokesperson for Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (RGASS), the government during the dialogue that happened following the May agitation had promised that changes would be made in the 9th Schedule of the Constitution at the Central level, thus fulfilling the government's promise on the issue of reservation.Also read | Rajasthan: Gujjars launch fresh stir demanding quota in government jobsHe claimed, ""Now our demand is for 5 per cent reservation to be set aside for the 5 castes within the OBC category.""SBC RESERVATION STRUCK DOWN THIS YEARThe SBC reservation was struck down for the second time this year. Earlier, even in 2013, the court had come down heavily on the move to create a separate category for the Gujjars and other castes that took the total percentage beyond 50.The issue of Gujjar reservation has been a sensitive one in Rajasthan. On several previous occasions, their agitation has turned violent claiming several lives. In 2008, under Vasundhara Raje's last tenure as CM, the police had opened fire on the agitating Gujjars, resulting in deaths of more than 70 of them. The present government is hoping that the current reservation problem is resolved soon so that it does not have an adverse impact on the electoral prospects of the BJP during the next elections.

375,"The outgoing Indian Air Force Chief Arup Raha on Wednesday said the worst moment during his tenure was when he heard about an AN-32 plane going missing with 29 personnel on board. Citing that the IAF undertook over 1,000 flying hours to search for the plane, Raha termed it as a mistake of not fitting AN-32s with underwater locator beacons."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe 24th chief of the Indian Air Force (IAF), Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha today addressed a press conference he termed as 'customary' for an outgoing air chief. Though many from the press corps disagreed, it made for a candid interaction with the man who has been at the helm of not just the IAF for three full years but also was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC), the apex tri-service body for nearly 29 months.KEY EXCERPTS:IAF's fighter planes: The teeth of any air force is in its fighter planes. The government has allowed us 42 squadrons. As of now, we have a large number of Sukhoi 30 (10 squadrons inducted and three more will be done soon). We are doing a mid life upgrade and we foresee them to be around for the next 30 years. The Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) TEJAS is a good, fourth generation plus aircraft. The Rafale is an excellent aircraft which will prove its worth in any scenario. We have just signed up for 36 planes. In the next 5-10 years time, we need more. One more line of aircraft production is required in India under the Make In India program. Need about 200 fighters over next 5-10 years. We have enough heavy fighters (like Sukhoi) but we need more in the medium segment.Worst moment: It came when I heard about the An32 missing with 29 personnel. We searched a lot, undertook 300 sorties, over 1000 flying hours. We had about 30 targets which look like the An32 debris. We have underwater assets which can search till the depth of 3.5km from the surface. From 30, there are now just 10 targets which remain to be verified. The underwater equipment to search could not do its job because there was a technical issue. We have approached the government to contract agencies from abroad who can search. Most of the Soviet era planes like the AN32 lack under water locator beacons. We have taken up with the government a case to procure such beacons. Within a month or two, a contract signed to arm all planes with such beacons. I feel, the An32 is not the best plane for this route. You can call it a mistake of not fitting these planes with the beacons.Defence corruption: From time to time, issues have come up. The investigating agencies have not been able to pin down those involved. It is not only the armed forces personnel who are involved in procurement. It will be premature to say anything in the AgustaWestland case. That a former IAF chief has been arrested obviously has consequences and the law of the land has to be followed. However, an ex IAF chief is like a family member to us and till a person is convicted, let us give him his due. If convicted, there should be no sympathy.China reacting to AGNI V test: Posturing will always be there. We should go about our task. Unless there is something being done which is prohibited like nuclear proliferation which is also happening by the way in our neighbourhood, if we are legitimately developing our capability, I do not think anybody should object.On air to air refueling planes of the IAF: The aircraft we have for the job are not very good on serviceability. We need much more. Unfortunately, anomalies came up and acquisition had been cancelled. Very unfortunate but you can't help it.Military diplomacy: We've done well. We convinced the government to step up military cooperation with nations in our neighbourhood, the SAARC region, far-east. Now the government is ready to sell them equipment too. This will help fill the void which our adversaries would have exploited.Disaster response: We thought we may or may not fight a conventional war but we have to be there to serve our people. We have been the first responders in our international humanitarian missions. We have aided the governments be it during the Jat agitation, running its mints 24x7 etc. We are also helping BSF, ARC, paramilitary forces and anti-Maoist operations.OROP: The agitation was a setback. It affected the esteem of the armed forces. I could not stem the agitation. What the government has given is reasonably good. I have told my people to accept it. Anomalies ought to resolved, including those from the seventh pay commission.Post-Pathankot: Much has been discussed and we are implementing the lessons learnt. We are now well prepared to tackle terrorist attacks. A lot has been done in training, orientation, weapons are being improved, field-craft has been improved. We are training a large number of manpower. Government has given us the authority to have 27 GARUD commando flights (each with 45 men) and 23 more have been sanctioned, taking it to total of 50 GARUD commando flights.Demonetisation: A huge initiative and we have along with the government realized the hardship caused to people. We have pitched in to carry cash from the mints. Our C130 and C17 planes have been deployed in ferrying cash across the country. We have flown 35 sorties ad carried 620 tones of cash.Enhancing operational efficiency: We have flown a lot more by the night. Average flying by night earlier was 17-20 per cent. Now it is about 30 per cent. We are exercising more. Serviceability of the planes was not very good. Many cases, contracts for spares have been signed and flagged to help the situation improve. Now serviceability has gone up by 5-7 per cent. Despite retiring older planes, we are achieving much more flying hours than in the past. By March-April next year, we will operationalise the second C130 squadron at Panagarh.Writer is a senior special correspondent with India Today TV and tweets @JRPUR Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

Flexible embeddable battery and sensor contain a chemical potentially unsafe for humans and their charging times varied.The new diaper sensors overcome all of those problems by using a urine-activated battery, Gizmodo reported.Batteries operate based on the function of two electrodes separated by an electrolyte. The scientists embedded two flexible electrodes into a disposable diaper for their tests.The battery attaches to a tiny capacitor for storing the generated electricity, and a transmitter which can beam its signal to a receiver up to 16 feet away.The research was published in the IEEE Sensors Journal.

Tunisia’s president has told the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, that he firmly condemns the “cowardly terrorist act” in Berlin.In a statement on Friday, Beji Caid Essebsi called for tighter cooperation to fight “the plague of terrorism that threatens the security and stability of all countries”.The alleged attacker, Anis Amri, who was shot dead on Friday, was a Tunisian national. He was supposed to have been deported from Germany, but authorities said they could not get the right papers from Tunisia.Tunisian authorities say the reason it took so long to issue Amri’s papers is that they needed to carry out so many identity checks. Amri reportedly used at least six different names and three different nationalities in his travels around Europe.Updated

Chelsea have agreed terms with Shanghai SIPG for the permanent transfer of Oscar. The 25-year-old midfielder will join the Chinese Super League side at the beginning of the January transfer window after four and a half years at Stamford Bridge.During that time the Brazil international has won the Premier League, Europa League and League Cup but, more recently, he has found his chances limited under Antonio Conte.The deal is understood to be around £52m, with Oscar reportedly earning £400,000 a week. A statement on the Chelsea website said: “We thank Oscar for his wonderful service and wish him the very best of luck.”Oscar will join the former Chelsea manager André Villas-Boas at Shanghai SIPG and is the latest player to move to China.The former Chelsea striker Demba Ba is at Shanghai Shenhua while Graziano Pellè swapped Southampton for Shandong Luneng in July for a reported £13m.Ramires, Gervinho, Hulk and Ezequiel Lavezzi have also been tempted to head to south-east Asia and more could follow in January.Conte has recently spoken of the “danger” posed by Chinese Super League sides, who now have the financial power to outbid Premier League clubs.Speaking last week he said: “The Chinese market is a danger for all teams in the world; not only for Chelsea but all teams in the world. But I think we must be concentrated on our work. I think this league is fantastic and to play in this league is a great opportunity, a great honour.“You must be very proud to play in this league.

A defensive mistake in the Korean penalty circle saw the ball fall to Sangita who flashed a shot across the goal with Mahima waiting for the opportunity at the far post. But the weight on the pass was too much for Mahima as the chance went wide.India took the lead minutes after the break as Ritu scored the opener off a penalty corner.A few minutes later, some brilliant interplay between Lalremsiami and Sangita saw the latter's shot stopped on the line illegally as India were awarded a penalty stroke. But Manpreet Kaur's attempt to convert the stroke was denied by South Korean goalkeeper Lee Da Bom.In the 55th minute, the duo combined again, Lalremsiami intercepting a Korean pass and showing great vision to pick out an inch perfect through to Sangita, who cut past two defenders to slot the ball into the goal and extend India's lead.The third goal came off a similar route, Sangita scoring her second of the game in the 58th minute.From there on, India held firm control over the game, and held off a late Korean penalty corner to complete a deserved victory.

India has won 14 Tests and drawn four in Kohli's unbeaten streak. India, led by Kohli, has been unbeaten since August 2015, which is also the longest Test streak for the team."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowAfter taking an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series against England, India will be looking to hammer the final nail in the coffin in Chennai. (Virat Kohli-Ravichandran Ashwin are the new Sachin Tendulkar-Anil Kumble of Indian cricket)If Virat Kohli and his men win the final Test starting tomorrow at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, it will be their biggest against England, the previous being the 3-0 whitewash in 1992-93 under Mohammad Azharuddin's captaincy.It will be a sweet revenge for the twin defeats, including a 4-0 drubbing in 2011, which India suffered at the hands of England in the last two series. (Virat Kohli wants to raise an all-time best team)Here are some of the interesting numbers to watch out for.Best series results for India (3-0 or more):A win or draw will give India their longest streak without a defeat. India have now not suffered a single defeat in last 17 consecutive Tests. Their last defeat was against Sri Lanka at Galle in August 2015. There has been another instance when Indian did not lose 17 consecutive Tests. This streak had come between 1985 and 1987. Kohli-led India have a chance to better their previous best. (Kohli keen to play county cricket before 2018 England tour)India's longest streaks without suffering a defeat:      Virat Kohli has now not suffered a single defeat in his last 17 Tests as captain. Among all Indian captains only one has a longer undefeated streak. Take a look:Longest unbeaten streaks for Indian captains:India have now won eight Tests in 2016, which are the joint-most they have won in a calendar year. Another win at Chennai will make it nine this year - a new record. (Running out of adjectives for Kohli and Ashwin: Ganguly to India Today)Most Test wins by India in a calendar yearThe series has been mighty successful for Virat Kohli - both as a batsman and as a captain. He has already set a plethora of records in the series and in the calendar year 2016. There are few more which are likely to be made in the Chennai Test. Take a look:As a batsman:Another 47 runs and Kohli will establish a new record of most runs in international cricket (Tests, ODIs & T20Is) by an Indian in a calendar year. Rahul Dravid had made 2626 runs in 53 matches in 1999. Kohli has so far aggregated 2580 runs in just 36 matches in 2016. (Virat Kohli one of the batting greats of our generation: Alastair Cook)Another 51 runs and Kohli will become first Indian captain to aggregate 1000 runs in a season. He will be the first Indian player to aggregate 1000 runs in a season since Gautam Gambhir, who aggregated 1269 runs in 2008-09 season, which incidentally is also the highest tally by an Indian in a season.Another 53 runs and Kohli will surpass his personal best in a series. Kohli had made 692 runs against Australia in Australia in 2014-15.Another 93 runs and Kohli will establish a new record of most runs by an Indian captain in a series. Sunil Gavaskar had made 732 runs against West Indies at home in 1978-89 - in a six match series.Another century and Kohli will beat Sachin Tendulkar's Indian record of most centuries in a calendar year. Tendulkar's had scored four centuries in 1997.Another 113 runs and Kohli will set a new record of most runs in a series in India-England Tests. Graham Gooch had made 752 in 1990.Another 135 runs and Kohli will set a new record of most runs by an Indian in a series. Gavaskar had made 774 against West Indies in West Indies in four matches (in his debut series).If he manages to score one more double ton, Gavaskar will become first captain to score four double tons in a calendar year. He will also be only the second player to do so after Michael Clarke who did so in 2012.As a captain:A draw at Chennai and Kohli will equal Gavaskar's Indian record of longest unbeaten streak as a captain. Gavaskar had led India in 18 consecutive Tests without a defeat between 1976 and 1980.Another win and Kohli will become first Indian captain to win four Tests vs England. Ajit Wadekar, Mohammad Azharuddin and MS MS Dhoni have won three.Kohli has not yet lost a Test as captain at home soil.What Kohli has done with the bat, R Ashwin has done the same with the ball. With 27 wickets in the series so far, Ashwin is the best bowler in the series from either side by a distance.After 43 Tests Ashwin's wicket-tally stands at 247, which is the highest for any bowler - spinner or pacer - at this stage. Dennis Lillee and Waqar Younis shared the previous record with 222 wickets. In all probability Ashwin will break Dennis Lillee's record of being the fastest to 250 wickets in Test cricket at Chennai.In last two years (2015 & 2016) Ashwin has taken 15 five-wicket hauls, which is a record for any bowler in two consecutive years. The previous record was 14 five-wicket hauls by Muttiah Muralitharan (twice).Ashwin has now taken 25 wickets in a series on four occasions - joint-most by an Indian with Kapil Dev. Interestingly Kapil did so in 38 series, Ashwin has played only 15.Indian bowlers with most instances of 25 wickets in a series:Occasions     Bowler               Series Played4                   R Ashwin                 154                   Kapil Dev                 383                   Bishan Singh Bedi    19The frequency with which Ashwin is winning the man of the series awards one after the other is simply mind-boggling. He has so far won seven MoS awards, which are the most by an Indian in Test cricket. Players like Kapil Dev, Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble, etc., all pale away in comparison. Ashwin's seven player of series awards are the most by an Indian (Sehwag and Tendulkar had won five each). There are only five players who have won more awards than Ashwin. The frequency at which Ashwin is winning his awards is simply mind-blowing - an award every two series on an average.Most man of the series awards for India:R Ashwin - 7Virender Sehwag - 5Sachin Tendulkar - 5Harbhajan Singh - 4Kapil Dev - 4Rahul Dravid - 4Anil Kumble - 4Quite astonishingly Ashwin has been Man of the Series in last four consecutive series - vs Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka (2015), vs South Africa in India (2015-16), vs West Indies in West Indies (2016) and vs New Zealand in India (2016-17). If he wins another Man of the Series award, he will create a world record of most consecutive series awards. Ashwin has now taken seven 10-wicket hauls in a Test. Among the Indians only Anil Kumble is ahead of him with eight hauls. The frequency at which Ashwin has taken a 10-wicket match hauls is simply astonishing.     Venue Stats:Chennai's MA Chidambaram Stadium (Chepauk) has been one of India's happy hunting grounds. In fact, Chennai and Delhi's Feroz Shah Kotla are the two grounds where India have won most Tests (13 each).In last 30 years India have lost only one Test at Chennai - vs Pakistan in January 1999 - a match they lost by 16 runs.India's win-loss record at Chennai:   Average scores at Chennai (last 5 Tests):  Pace vs Spin at Chennai (last 5 Tests):  Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

Austria’s parliament has passed a law allowing authorities to expropriate the house in which Adolf Hitler was born in 1889.The law, passed on Wednesday night, ends years of dispute between the building’s owner, Gerlinde Pommer, and the authorities in Braunau am Inn. For years, Pommer refused to sell the building or allow it to be renovated.Pommer, who once ran it as a guesthouse and was compensated by the government with a generous level of rent to prevent it from becoming a lure for neo-Nazi tourists, is due to be compensated for the loss of the three-storey house with an undisclosed sum. But quite what the government plans to do with it remains unclear.While their main aim is to prevent the building becoming a shrine for the steady stream of neo-Nazi supporters who still make their way to Braunau, there has been an ongoing discussion over what more positive purpose it might serve. Ideas have ranged from turning it into a labour office or a cultural centre to tearing it down altogether, though detractors say that would amount to an attempt to erase Austria’s Nazi past. Heritage experts are against pulling it down, arguing the house has an important place in Braunau’s architectural history.Marcus Franz, an independent politician, has suggested the Bulgarian wrapping artist Christo should be invited to cover it up as an art installation.Previous uses have included a workshop for people with learning difficulties and a day centre operated by a local charity, which rented the building from Pommer but was forced to give up the lease after she refused to carry out any repairs.Hitler was born on the top floor of the house on 20 April 1889. Close to the border with Germany, Braunau has never been able to shake its association with the Nazi leader. “It is not so seldom that neo-Nazis stop in front of the house to be photographed making the Hitler greeting,” Harry Buchmayr, a Social Democrat who lives in Braunau, told parliament. Walter Rosenkranz, of the rightwing Freedom party, defended parliament’s decision to buy the building. “Expropriation is not a nice thing, rather the last resort,” he said. “But we’ve had five years of negotiations that were carried out in a very considerate way, but which didn’t lead to any result.”"

Jews are better educated than any other major religious group in the world, with an average of 13.4 years of schooling and a majority going on to higher education, a study has found.At the other end of the educational scale, Hindus and Muslims have the fewest years of formal schooling, with an average of 5.6 years.The main reason for the disparity is that Jews are largely concentrated in Israel and the US, countries with high levels of education generally, whereas 98% of the world’s Hindus live in the developing countries of India, Nepal and Bangladesh.Among Muslims, those that live in countries with strong economies are well-educated, but those who live in developing regions have comparatively short periods of formal schooling – and girls fare worse than boys.But there are also notable differences between religious groups in the same areas of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where Christians are generally better educated than Muslims.The study, Religion and Education Around the World, was published on Tuesday by the Washington-based Pew Research Center.It found that, compared with the Jewish average of more than 13 years of formal schooling, Christians had 9.3 years, Buddhists 7.9, and Muslims and Hindus 5.6. Adults with no religious affiliation spend 8.8 years in school on average.Almost one in five of all adults – more than 680 million people – received no formal schooling, but for Muslims and Hindus, the number missing out on education rose to around two in five.However, in recent years the amount of time spent at school has increased among all groups.According to Pew, the youngest Hindus in the study (born between 1976 and 1985) spent an average of 7.1 years in school – nearly twice as long as the oldest Hindus (born between 1936 and 1955).Within three generations, Muslims, similarly, were spending an extra three years at school, with an extra 2.5 years for Buddhists. Over the same period, Christians gained just an extra year and Jews less than half a year.Among religiously unaffiliated adults, the youngest had an extra 2.9 years in school, overtaking Christians for the number of school years for this age group.Pew found similar changes when looking at the educational gender gap. Although overall a much higher proportion of women had received no formal education, and those that had generally spent fewer years in school, the gap was shrinking with successive generations.But among Hindus, there was still an 18-point gap between the youngest men and women, with 38% of women having no formal education compared with 20% of men.The gender gap among the youngest Muslims was 10 points, with 33% of women not going to school compared with 23% of men.The religiously unaffiliated had closed the gap within three generations, although there were still 2% of men and women having no formal education.In higher education, Jews strikingly reversed the gender gap. In the youngest group, 69% of women have degrees compared with 57% of men – reversing a seven-point gap in favour of men among the oldest Jews to a 12-point gap in favour of women. Christians and the religiously unaffiliated also reversed gaps but to a lesser extent.The report emphasises the difference in education between people in economically developed areas and those in poorer, less developed ones, regardless of religion. Among the factors affecting education levels are socioeconomic conditions, armed conflict, child labour and child marriage.Christians in Europe and North America tend to be much more highly educated than those in sub-Saharan Africa.Hindus have relatively low levels of education in India, Bangladesh and Nepal – but in the US, 96% have college degrees, a higher share than any other major religious group.In general, religious minorities in the US are more likely to have college degrees than the Christian majority (Hindus 96%, Jews 75%, Muslims 54%, Buddhists 53%, unaffiliated 44%, Christians 36%).In sub-Saharan Africa, Muslims are more than twice as likely as Christians to have no formal schooling – and the gap is widening.The report says: “Some scholars suggest that the source of the Christian-Muslim attainment gap is rooted in the location of Christian missionary activity during colonial times. Missionary-built educational facilities were often located in what became heavily Christian areas rather than predominantly Muslim locales … As a result, Christians gained an educational edge over Muslims that lasted decades.”"

The UN has dropped the superhero Wonder Woman as an ambassador for empowering girls and women after a brief stint that drew widespread criticism.The campaign around the comic book character, who turned 75 this autumn, lasted for less than two months. Among its key aims were challenging female stereotypes and fighting discrimination and violence against women and girls.But the appointment prompted an angry backlash from some quarters. More than 44,000 people signed a petition that claimed to have been started by “concerned United Nations staff members” which called on the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to appoint a non-fictional woman to the role.“It is alarming that the United Nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualised image at a time when the headline news in United States and the world is the objectification of women and girls,” the petition’s authors wrote.Her scanty clothing – “a shimmery, thigh-baring bodysuit with an American flag motif and knee-high boots” – meant that deploying her as a role model for the UN was culturally insensitive in many parts of the world, the petition added.Wonder Woman’s tenure as an honorary ambassador was launched on 21 October with an event that saw a silent protest by audience members who turned their backs on the panel, which included current and former Wonder Woman actors Gal Gadot and Lynda Carter.Others protested in the lobby, holding up signs that said “I’m not a mascot” and “Let’s get real”.Diane Nelson, president of DC Entertainment, the Warner Bros subsidiary behind Wonder Woman, told the event the campaign would feature various initiatives “over the course of the next year”, suggesting that the partnership was envisaged to last into 2017.But now the UN has confirmed Wonder Woman’s time as an honorary ambassador will end this week. “From the UN’s side, there was no plan for it to be much longer than this,” said Jeffrey Brez, the UN’s chief of NGO relations and advocacy.DC Entertainment had approached the UN to explore a joint project to mark the character’s 75th birthday, Brez said. The campaign aimed to harness Wonder Woman’s popularity to allow the UN to target new audiences with its messages on equality for women and girls.The angry response in some quarters prompted the UN to make celebrating the achievements of “real-life Wonder Women” one of the campaign’s core goals.The collaboration had lasted longer than previous UN roles given to fictional characters, Brez added, pointing out that a character from the video game Angry Birds served as climate change ambassador for a single day in March.Other fictional characters to have been given honorary roles include Winnie the Pooh as honorary ambassador for friendship in 1997, and Tinkerbell as honorary ambassador for “green” to promote environmental awareness in 2009.Warner Bros and DC Entertainment have been “extremely pleased” with the partnership’s role in raising awareness of the empowerment of women and girls, a spokeswoman said.“Wonder Woman stands for peace, justice and equality, and for 75 years she has been a motivating force for many and will continue to be long after the conclusion of her UN honorary ambassadorship.”"

Located just behind Amsterdam Centraal station with views looking out across the river IJ, Al Ponte is a popular cafe serving a constant stream of commuters on their way to and from the nearby ferry port. Not all Al Ponte’s customers pay for their coffees, however. Not in the traditional sense anyway.Al Ponte is one of the businesses participating in Wasted, a pilot project running in Amsterdam’s Noord district which incentivises households to recycle their plastics by rewarding them with discounts at local businesses.When prospective participants sign up they are given bags labelled with unique QR codes, enabling the scheme’s organisers to apportion the correct credit to each household once the filled bags have been collected. For every bag of plastics they produce households earn one green coin. At present the coins are sent to users in the post, although next year Wasted’s organisers want to develop the scheme’s digital currency. As well as reducing bureaucracy, this will enable them to engage online businesses in offering rewardsAt Al Ponte, one coin earns users a free second coffee. Meanwhile, over at BeekhovenBikes Fietsspecialist’s cycle shop three coins earn users 50% off tyre repairs. Discounts on accountancy support, groceries and reiki treatments are also included in the list of rewards offered by the 30 or so participating retailers.Silvia Salani, who owns Al Ponte, says there are days when only one or two customers have a coin to exchange and others when that number reaches double figures. As well as improving her standing in the community, Salani believes being part of the scheme has been positive for business growth as she sees those who first came in with friends for free coffees returning as paid customers.Since Wasted was set up in early 2015 by Dutch non-profit the Cities Foundation, more than 700 households have signed up. In a previous iteration of the project, staff from the Cities Foundation collected the plastics from users’ homes and fed them into the municipal recycling scheme. As the project has scaled, however, the city council, which subsidises the project, has taken over the weekly collection.The city council doesn’t normally offer domestic collection of recyclables, instead providing Noord’s 87,000 residents with on-street containers. With Wasted, however, it has said is keen to support the Cities Foundation’s goal to connect waste management with supporting local entrepreneurs.In a recent survey of Wasted users, 52% of respondents said they had improved their waste disposal habits as a result of using Wasted and 23% said they had reduced their total plastics consumption. “People start to realise how much plastic they produce on a weekly basis and it is pretty distressing,” says Francesca Miazzo, founder of the Cities Foundation.Broader research to date suggests schemes that reward residents to recycle have mixed long-term results. A study carried out by independent consultancy Eunomia, commissioned by Serco, shows such initiatives have “highly variable” results.“Unfortunately there’s no real indication that reward schemes outperform simply publicising pre-existing recycling scheme information,” says Peter Jones, a principal consultant at Eunomia. While Miazzo acknowledges the long-term challenge, she believes activating community participation and creating awareness can help sustain positive behaviour: “We want to engage those who don’t usually care about recycling, while building a social contract between the community and business owners that goes beyond the traditional consumer relationship,” she says.

Peep peep! That’s an excellent win for Chelsea, precisely because they struggled so much against an admirable West Brom. It took a mistake from Garath McAuley and a storming finish from Diego Costa to decide the match, and Chelsea have now won nine league matches in a row.

90+1 min There will be four added minutes of painful hope for West Brom fans.

8.47am EST

90 min Chelsea have looked so dangerous on the counter-attack since going 1-0 up. They really aren’t the kind of team you want to trail. Swansea are the only team to take a point off Chelsea after being behind this season.

8.44am EST

88 min Costa’s cut-back is stabbed wide by Fabregas, who then has the brass neck to look outraged when Mike Dean gives a goal-kick. Matic is then booked for a tactical foul.

85 min Cahill’s headed clearance comes to Dawson, who chests the ball down and volleys it into orbit. It wouldn’t sit down for him.

This demonstrated everything that is good about Costa. Fabregas lobbed a nothing ball down the right wing, which seemed to be covered by McAuley. Costa made a virtue of a lost cause, muscling McAuley aside before charging into the area.

67 min Rondon has had a superb game, particularly with his hold-up play. Now he lumbers down the left side of the box and drags an inviting cutback through Luiz’s legs towards the penalty spot. Fletcher, arriving late, looks set for a simple finish from 10 yards only for Cahill to change direction and make a terrific sliding clearance. Updated

63 min Antonio Conte makes a change, bringing on Willian for Pedro. He worked hard but achieved little.

8.18am EST
08:18

61 min The resulting free-kick from Luiz deflects off Hazard in the wall and bounces just wide of the post. Foster had it covered and helped push it wide; Mike Dean missed that and gave a goalkick for the deflection off Hazard. Robbie Savage, who never made a minor mistake in his entire football career, chastises Dean.

8.17am EST
08:17

60 min Dawson, already booked, clatters into Costa 25 yards from goal. Most refs would have given a second yellow card for that; Mike Dean Esq. is not most refs. I think it was the right decision, just about.

8.16am EST

47 min “While I take umbrage with your assertion that Hazard is the best player in ‘this league’ right now - that clearly is Sanchez - I do thank you for that Southampton clip,” says Kelvin. “That truly was a magnificent goal.

This time the bone of contention is the flood relief assistance which Bihar government has sought from the Centre to deal with aftermath of massive floods that hit the state this year.The Centre rejecting the request made by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to provide flood relief assistance to the state to deal with the post-flood situation has directed the Bihar government to first spend the funds it has under State Disaster Fund before seeking any kind of central assistance.It may be noted that the Bihar government at present has Rs 1,859 crore in the State Disaster Fund and the Centre has directed it to spend this amount first as relief and rehabilitation for flood victims and compensation to farmers for crop losses.

457,"""A lawyer acting for the woman who made rape allegations against WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange has accused him of """"violating"""" her client in the media. This comes after Assange released a public statement giving details of his relationship with the rape accuser. Assange said he released the statement because he wanted people to know """"how abusive"""" the process has been.""","Elisabeth Massi Fritz says Assange’s decision to release statement detailing his relationship with accuser is ‘unfortunate’A lawyer acting for the woman who made rape allegations against Julian Assange has accused him of “violating” her client in the media, after the WikiLeaks founder released a statement detailing answers he gave to Swedish investigators.Assange on Wednesday thumbed his nose at Swedish officials, who he says have robbed him of his freedom for six years, by releasing the answers he gave to them under questioning at Ecuador’s London embassy last month.The statement sets out for the first time a detailed account by Assange of his encounter with the woman in August 2010.Elisabeth Massi Fritz, the lawyer for the accuser, said Assange’s decision to release details of their relationship in the statement was “unfortunate”.She later accused Assange of “violating” her client in the media. “Assange seems to be desperate. As soon as he has something to say he calls the media and is conducting the investigation through the media,” she told the Swedish broadcaster SVT.“The only thing I can say is that Assange has low credibility, which we will prove when we prosecute. I expect the prosecutor to issue charges. I also expect Assange to stop violating my client in the media. She has suffered more than enough for six years.”The transcript of a police interview with the woman was leaked to the media in December 2010, which the Australian, who has not been charged with any crime, says helped to establish an aura of guilt around him.Since then, Assange has repeatedly asked to be allowed to tell his side of the story to prosecutors, but until recently they insisted he come to Sweden for questioning. Assange has been confined to Ecuador’s London embassy since June 2012 after claiming asylum to avoid extradition over the allegations.“I am now releasing my statement to the public,” Assange said in a letter accompanying the document on Wednesday. “The reason is simple. I want people to know the truth about how abusive this process has been.”The release of the statement was expected to prompt dismay in Sweden, where prosecutors’ desire for personal aspects of the case to remain confidential has led them to deny Assange access to evidence against him because of the risk that it might become public.In correspondence with Ecuador over the conditions of Assange’s interrogation, the Swedish prosecutor in the case, Marianne Ny, insisted the proceedings remain private to protect the plaintiff. A spokesperson for Ny told the Guardian she was awaiting the formal report on the interviews from Ecuador, due this month, before deciding on her next step.The statement, which Assange read out to investigators in response to their questioning, contains a sustained attack on the prosecutor, for whom he claims the interview in London was “simply a ruse to tick a box to ensure the technical possibility to indict me”. Under Swedish law, an interview with the suspect is an essential step before issuing charges.The statement fleshes out Assange’s argument that he is at risk of extradition from Sweden to the US to face espionage charges – and potentially a life behind bars.Last week the UN’s working group on arbitrary detention rejected an appeal by the UK against its February ruling that the risks facing Assange if he left the embassy meant his situation amounted to a prolonged deprivation of liberty “in breach of the principles of reasonableness, necessity and proportionality”.Until now, Assange has not described his sexual encounter with his accuser. He has not publicly apologised to her or tried to mitigate the distress she says she has been caused.Assange’s statement says that, owing to US hostility towards WikiLeaks, his bank cards were blocked after his arrival in Sweden in the summer of 2010 at the peak of the Pentagon’s conflict with him over the release of a trove of diplomatic and military documents. He says this made him highly dependent on the hospitality of others.The woman “appeared to be sympathetic to my plight and also appeared to be romantically interested in me”, Assange told prosecutors. “She was not close to people I was close to, so it seemed that those who meant me harm would be unlikely to try to find me by monitoring her movements.”She “made it very clear that she wanted to have sexual intercourse” with Assange and placed his hands on her breasts while in a cinema, he continued. “I felt concerned about the intensity of [her] interest and I also deeply loved another woman, which played on my mind and left me emotionally distracted.”The intensity of her interest made him fear how she might react if she felt he was rejecting her, he said. He claimed he later discovered she had collected dozens of photos of him in the weeks before they met, her Flickr photo account filled with “pages and pages” of photos of Assange.After they had unprotected sex, she wanted him to have a test for sexually transmitted diseases, the statement continues.“We were in agreement and arranged to meet the following day in the nearby park around lunchtime, when I would have time to get tested. She said she was fine and seemed at ease. You can imagine my disbelief when I woke the next morning to the news that I had been arrested in my absence for ‘rape’ and that police were ‘hunting’ all over Stockholm for me.”Assange claims that text messages sent by the woman at the time – access to which his lawyers were allowed only briefly and early in the case – show she was not asleep during the sex.According to the transcripts leaked to the Guardian in 2010, the woman told police she met Assange at a seminar at which he was speaking, and afterwards went to the cinema with him, where they kissed in the back row.Two days later, she arranged to meet him and they went to her flat. They started to have sex, she said, but she moved away because Assange had not wanted to wear a condom, and he fell asleep. She told police they later had sex at least once when he had “unwillingly” worn a condom, but the following morning, after she had gone to buy breakfast and then climbed back into bed and fallen asleep, she had woken to find him having sex with her without a condom.According to the statement, she told him: “You better not have HIV,” and he answered: “Of course not,” but “she couldn’t be bothered to tell him one more time because she had been going on about the condom all night. She had never had unprotected sex before.” The statement says she bought the morning-after pill and took an STD test but when she telephoned Assange asking him to be tested he said he didn’t have the time.Assange has made no secret of his contempt for the Swedish prosecutor, but his decision to release his side of the story appears calculated to place further pressure on Ny to end the stalemate in the case, either by issuing a rape charge – and implicitly explaining the evidence for the charge – or lifting the arrest warrant against him.“In the past the prosecution has fed partial information to tabloids that politically oppose me,” Assange said. “It is better that my statement, which I am happy with, and which makes it obvious to all that I am innocent, sees the light in full.”"

461,"South Korea has proposed military talks with North Korea to ease tensions over the latter's nuclear and ballistic missile programme, for the first time under President Moon Jae-in. The offer by Jae-in, who has vowed to achieve peace with North Korea, comes after the reclusive state claimed to have test-fired its first intercontinental ballistic missile.","Seoul’s defence ministry wants to reboot moribund diplomacy as Red Cross renews attempts to reunite Korean familiesAgence France-Presse in Seoul

South Korea has offered to hold rare military talks with the North to ease tensions after Pyongyang’s first intercontinental ballistic missile test earlier this month.Monday’s offer, the first since South Korea elected the moderate Moon Jae-In as president, came as the Red Cross in Seoul proposed a separate meeting to discuss the reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean war.The South’s defence ministry proposed a meeting on Friday at the border truce village of Panmunjom, while the Red Cross offered to hold talks on 1 August at the same venue.If the government meeting goes ahead, it will be the first official inter-Korea talks since December 2015. Moon’s conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye, had refused to engage in substantive dialogue with Pyongyang unless the isolated regime made a tangible commitment to denuclearisation.The Red Cross said it hoped for a positive response from its counterpart in the North; mooted family reunions in early October would be the first in two years.Millions of families were separated by the conflict that sealed the division of the peninsula. Many died without getting a chance to see or hear from their families on the other side of the heavily-fortified border, across which all civilian communication is banned. Only about 60,000 members of divided families are still left in the South. “North Korea should respond to our sincere proposals if it really seeks peace on the Korean Peninsula,” said Cho Myoung-gyon, Seoul’s unification minister in charge of North Korea affairs.Cho stressed that Seoul “would not seek collapse of the North or unification through absorbing the North” and urged Pyongyang to restore inter-Korea communication channels, including a shuttered military hotline. Moon, who took power in May, has advocated dialogue with the nuclear-armed North as a means of bringing it to the negotiating table and vowed to play a more active role in global efforts to tame the South’s unpredictable neighbour.But Pyongyang has staged a series of missile launches in violation of UN resolutions, most recently on 4 July when it test-fired its first ICBM, a move which triggered global alarm and a push by the US president, Donald Trump, to impose harsher UN sanctions on the country.Washington has also called on China, the North’s sole ally, to put more pressure on Pyongyang to rein in its nuclear ambitions, which have advanced rapidly under the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un. “We make the proposal for a meeting … aimed at stopping all hostile activities that escalate military tension along the land border,” the defence ministry said in a statement.[NEW]The European Union offered European support for South Korean efforts to negotiate with North Korea, but said it was also considering tougher sanctions on Pyongyang following its first intercontinental ballistic missile test.In a statement Monday, the EU’s executive arm condemned the test earlier this month as a “serious threat to international peace and security” and urged an end to such actions.The latest missile test – which Kim described as a “gift” to the Americans – was seen as a milestone in Pyongyang’s quest to build a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead that can hit the US mainland.The proposed meetings, if realised, would be a “rare opportunity to ease tension that has built up for 10 years”, said Cheong Seong-chang, analyst at the Sejong Institute, a thinktank.“It would at least help let off some steam out of the current crisis, although the North would still maintain that it would not give up its weapons programmes,” he said. The agenda for the meeting could include moves to suspend propaganda campaigns operated on both sides of the border for years, Cheong added. The South’s military has deployed dozens of giant loudspeakers along the tense border to blare out a mix of world news, K-pop songs and other propaganda targeting young North Korean soldiers. It has also occasionally launched giant balloons containing anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border despite warnings of military retaliation by the North.The North has responded with its own propaganda broadcasts and sent anti-Seoul leaflets via giant balloons across the border.

462,"""Donald Trump's six-month approval rating stands at 36%, the lowest among all US Presidents in the last 70 years, according to a national poll published on Sunday.

Donald Trump’s approval rating has plunged in a national poll, published on Sunday, that charts Americans’ perceptions of a stalling domestic policy agenda and declining leadership on the world stage. The Washington Post/ABC News poll, which put Trump’s six-month approval rating at a historic 70-year low, came amid mounting controversy over Russian interference in the 2016 election. It emerged on Saturday that Trump’s campaign committee made a payment to the legal firm representing the president’s eldest son almost two weeks before a meeting between Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer promising compromising information on Hillary Clinton was made public.Trump now has a 36% approval rating, down six points from his first 100 days’ rating. The poll found that 48% believed America’s leadership in the world is weaker than before the billionaire took office, while support for Republican plans to replace Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act was at just 24% compared with 50% who support the former president’s signature healthcare policy. Trump, who has spent the weekend at his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, attempted to downplay the poll’s findings. On Sunday morning he used Twitter to claim, incorrectly, that “almost 40% [approval] is not bad at this time” and that the poll in question had been “just about the most inaccurate around election time!”.In fact, the Washington Post/ABC poll came close to predicting the popular vote on election day – which Hillary Clinton won by 2.5m ballots, Trump taking the White House in the electoral college – and no president has suffered such low ratings at this early stage in their tenure since such polling began in 1945.The poll also found that 63% of people thought the June 2016 meeting between senior members of Trump’s inner circle, including Donald Trump Jr and son-in-law Jared Kushner, and a group of Russians including the lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, was inappropriate.On Saturday, a campaign finance report filed to the Federal Election Commission revealed that Trump’s campaign committee had paid $50,000 to Trump Jr’s lawyer Alan Futerfas on 27 June, 13 days before the New York Times revealed the meeting had taken place. Trump himself told reporters on Wednesday he had only been made aware of the 2016 meeting, which occurred in Trump Tower, “two or three days ago” – raising the prospect that his campaign committee could have known about the contact before the president did. On Sunday, Trump’s personal attorney Jay Sekulow appeared on all five TV political talk shows to offer a spurious defense of the meeting. Sekulow appeared to blame secret service officers for allowing the Russians into Trump Tower. “I wonder why the secret service – if this was nefarious – why the secret service allowed these people in?” he told ABC News. “The president had secret service protection at that point, and that raised a question with me.”A spokesman for the secret service later confirmed that Trump Jr was not under the agency’s protection at the time of the meeting and “thus we would not have screened anyone he was meeting with”.Under pressure from the New York Times, Trump Jr this week released damning emails revealing he eagerly embraced what he was told was a Russian government attempt to damage the Clinton campaign.The emails show music promoter Rob Goldstone telling the future president’s son that “the crown prosecutor of Russia” had offered “to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father”.The New York Times reported that Trump signed off on his son’s first statement to the Times about the meeting, which like subsequent statements was soon revealed not to be a full account of events.Kushner, Trump’s senior adviser, and then campaign manager Paul Manafort also attended the meeting. It was revealed on Friday that Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian American lobbyist and former Soviet military officer, was present as well.Earlier on Sunday morning, Trump tweeted more outspoken support for his eldest son.“Hillary Clinton can illegally get the questions to the debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?” the president wrote.Trump has previously described the political storm over his son’s meeting as “the greatest witch-hunt in political history” and “sad!” and said anyone would have taken the meeting as offered.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Thursday, the president said 39-year-old Trump Jr was “a good boy” and added: “And he had a meeting, nothing happened with the meeting. It was a short meeting, as he told me – because I only heard about it two or three days ago.”The Trump campaign committee’s finance filing also shows it paid $89,000 to the Trump Corporation, which is led by Trump Jr and his brother, Eric, for “legal consulting”.It was announced on Saturday that Trump had hired Washington attorney Ty Cobb to serve as his special counsel regarding the Russia investigations being run by the Senate judiciary and intelligence committees and special counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director appointed after Trump fired his successor James Comey in May.The move seemingly reflects the president’s growing acceptance that the investigations will linger over his tenure for months or even years.On Sunday morning, he also tweeted: “Thank you to all of the supporters, who far out-numbered the protesters, yesterday at the Women’s US Open. Very cool!”The golfing event Trump referred to took place at his club where, according to reports, members pay up to $100,000 in joining fees. "

Naidu will contest against the Congress-led Opposition's candidate Gopalkrishna Gandhi, who is Mahatma Gandhi's grandson. The voting is scheduled for August 5 and the current Vice President Hamid Ansari's term will end on August 10."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowSenior BJP leader and union minister M Venkaiah Naidu was today picked as NDA's vice presidential nominee.The decision was taken at BJP's parliamentary board meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi this evening. Besides Naidu, names of Maharashtra Governor C Vidyasagar Rao and O Rajagopal were doing the rounds as probables for the coveted post.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah said the decision in favour of Venkaiah Naidu was consensus at the party meeting. For the August 5 vice presidential elections, Naidu will file his papers tomorrow as it is the last date for making nominations.With the ruling NDA backing him firmly, 68-year-old Naidu's victory seems easy.A BJP Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan, Naidu is a Minister for Urban Development, Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation, and Information and Broadcasting.The former BJP president has been pitted against former West Bengal Governor, diplomat and scholar Gopalkrishna Gandhi whose name has been finalised by an alliance of 18 opposition parties.Incumbent Vice President Hamid Ansari's term ends on August 10.The electoral college for the election consists of 790 MPs of the two Houses of Parliament.The ruling bloc enjoys an overwhelming majority in the electoral college and BJP has expressed confidence about garnering anywhere between 500 and 550 votes.Describing him as a fitting candidate for the office of Vice President, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he has always admired Naidu for his hardwork and tenacity.I know @MVenkaiahNaidu Garu for years.

While 37 candidates had filed their nominations for the 1977 Presidential elections, the Returning Officer rejected 36 after scrutiny and the only valid nomination was that of Neelam Sanjiva Reddy."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe voting for presidential election 2017 is underway and BJP pick Ram Nath Kovind is all set for a big win against Opposition candidate Meira Kumar.Of the total electoral college votes of 10,98,903, former Bihar governor Ram Nath Kovind is almost assured of 63 per cent of them.Besides BJP's allies in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), parties like Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) and Naveen Patnaik-led Biju Janata Dal (BJD) have also pledged support to Kovind in the presidential election.Before the votes are counted and the next President of India is announced on July 20, we take a look at some of the biggest and closest victory margins recorded in previous presidential elections.SOME OF THE WINS BY BIGGEST MARGINS:1977: Following the sudden death of President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed in February 1977, election to the post had to be conducted within the next six months.A total of 37 candidates filed their nominations for the presidential election, but on scrutiny the Returning Officer rejected 36 of them. The only valid nomination was that of Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy.In July 1977, Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy was declared the new President of India. This was the first time a candidate was declared elected to the highest office without a contest.1997: Two candidates were in the fray to succeed Shanker Dayal Sharma as the country's 11th president. They were K R Narayanan and T N Seshan. Narayanan won the presidential election with a huge margin and  polled 9,56,290 votes against 50,631 votes for Seshan.1962: Before the second term of Rajendra Prasad expired, the election to choose his successor was held. Those in contention were Dr Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, Chowdhry Hari Ram and Yamuna Prasad Trisulia.Dr Radhakrishnan won the election with an overwhelming margin and got 5,53,067 votes while the other two candidates together managed to get nearly 10,000 votes. (The value of votes was then calculated on the basis of the 1951 Census.)   1957: Before the first presidential term of Rajendra Prasad concluded, the election to elect the second President of India was held.Rajendra Prasad was once again in the fray along with Chowdhry Hari Ram and Nagendra Narayan Das. Prasad polled 4,59,698 votes against 2,000 votes for Narayan Das and 2,672 votes for Hari Ram. Rajendra Prasad became the President of India for a second time.2002: When the election to chose K R Narayanan's successor was held, APJ Abdul Kalam won it with a huge margin. Kalam was the overwhelming favourite and got 9,22,884 votes against 1,07,366 votes polled by Lakshmi Sahgal.SOME OF THE CLOSE FIGHTS FOR PRESIDENT's POST:1969: Following the sudden demise of Dr Zakir Hussain in May 1969, then Vice President V V Giri took charge as the acting president. Two months later, Giri resigned from both the positions--vice-president and acting president--to contest the presidential election.Of the 15 candidates, Giri polled 4,01,515 votes, while Sanjeeva Reddy got 3,13,548 votes.However, none of the two candidates secured the number of votes required to be elected as President of India. That year, the quota for selection was fixed at 4,18,169 votes. After the first count, several  candidates were excluded leaving only two people in the fray--V V Giri and N Sanjeeva Reddy. Eventually, Giri edged past the qouta mark with 4,20,277 votes while Reddy got 4,05,427 votes.V V Giri was declared elected to the post of India's president.1967: Seventeen candidates were in the fray for the presidential election that would choose Dr Radhakrishnan's successor.While 9 of the 17 candidates polled zero votes, the fight was close between Dr Zakir Hussain and Kota Subbarao.

Mind you, it could be worse... For one thing, South Africa could have had AB de Villiers, Dale Steyn and Kagiso Rabada in their ranks. For another, they could have held one of those early chances offered by Joe Root at Lord’s, in which case they might well be 2-0 up with two to play. An email from Andrew Benton. “The next Test will be the measure of Root’s captaincy. Can he make the changes necessary, and/or inspire the team? We should give him the series, only then can we pass judgement.” And even that might be a bit premature. I can’t see him losing the job before the Ashes, can you?

It’s an ill wind etc etc, as shown by this email from Smylers. “An upside of England managing to lose this Test inside four days is that tomorrow’s England Women’s World Cup semi-final against South Africa will now be live on the radio. After I complained about the men overshadowing the women’s exciting ODI against Australia, it seems only fair to credit Joe Root’s team with their swift improvement in this area.”

England only have four problem areas. First, the top order: they’re all left-handers, they’re all crabby, and with Alastair Cook’s form fading, they all struggle to deal with the stock Test-match delivery. In 12 innings, Cook, Keaton Jennings and Gary Ballance have made 246 at an average of 20, which is one shaky set of foundations. Second, Mark Wood. The quickest of England’s bowlers has also been the least incisive: he has one for 197 off 56 overs. Chris Woakes’s recovery from injury cannot come too soon.Third, Liam Dawson. A resourceful cricketer who bowled one great ball to dismiss Amla at Lord’s, Dawson is summed up by one stat: in his whole career, he has taken five wickets in a first-class innings three times. The equivalent figure for Adil Rashid is 19. As a pair, Rashid and Moeen Ali may be expensive, but at least they are penetrating. Dawson is not. He is a bits-and-pieces player who is not even making runs.Fourth, the balance of the side. The batting order is more like a disorder – too quiet at first, then too noisy, with three blockers followed by Root and four dashers. The selectors can be faulted for two things: preferring Dawson to Rashid, and picking only four specialist batsmen – two of whom, Jennings and Ballance, are now walking wickets.Updated

On a day like this, we’re all armchair selectors. And some wise heads are already gathering for the meeting...Jeremy Smith: “The reality is that England’s best number three is still Jonathan Trott, a 36-year-old who retired from international cricket two years ago on health grounds.”Zia Faruqui: “Are Buttler or Morgan really the solution? Surely both play in the same single devil-may-care mode as the current incumbents? Need Hameed back.”Neil Virani: “I’m quite amazed by people calling for Test players based on ODI performances. This match and several before are an indictment of employing a Test coach based on his short-form record. Bayliss seems to think every Test pitch is 500 par and every ODI pitch 350 par, and refuses to tell his team to adapt to the conditions.”Ashley Roberts: “We need to talk about Bayliss. He has been in the job for a few years now but I’m struggling to see how he has improved this Test team. England have batted appallingly in this match, but I think they are a lot more talented than this, which begs the question: why are they all giving their wickets away? Shouldn’t the coach have some influence over that and their type of play? We are seeing these England collapses time and again under Bayliss and, while the players have to accept responsibility, so does he.”Updated

A sharp point from the tireless John Starbuck. “Du Plessis now has only two Tests to knock the England captain from his perch. It must be a standard Saffer objective now. “Still,” he adds, “Trent Bridge lived up to its reputation as another three-day Test ground. You’ve got to laugh.”

10.09am EDT
10:09

So England were awful, but isn’t this great for the series? There is nothing worse than back-to-back Tests producing an instant 2-0, especially when there are only two Tests to come. The series has ebbed and flowed already, which is the life-blood of Test cricket. There’s now a week off, and a chance for England to regroup.

10.06am EDT
10:06

The first thing to say is not that England were awful, but South Africa were vastly improved. They bowled well, batted resolutely, fielded smartly, and above all they were well led. My colleague Rob Smyth reckons the man of the match should be Faf du Plessis, on the John Abrahams principle, and although it’s unlikely to happen, it may well be right. He came on stage as a very modern version of a deus ex machina: the captain returning from paternity leave. At Lord’s, Joe Root faced another novice at the toss; here, he faced a battle-hardened pro.Updated

44th over: England 133-8 (Dawson 5, Wood 0) And so the dismal procession continues.Our latest selector, ready to do a bit better than the real ones, is Anthony Hulse. “Picking up on the earlier discussion, it’s difficult to see what there is to lose by playing either of Morgan or Buttler. As has been pointed out, at least they have demonstrated the ability to get runs against international bowling attacks, under the sort of pressure which playing international sport brings. With modern run rates and batting approaches who’s to say there isn’t overall more in common between ODIs and Tests than there is between Tests and county cricket? I’m sure both of them are probably better at keeping out straight deliveries on a length than Gary Ballance is, although that’s not a desperately high bar to clear.”

Stokes, again trying to get down the track, connects with a push and Philander, mid-follow-through, snaffles superbly round about his shins. Everything is going right for South Africa; everything is going england for England. Updated

41st over: England 126-6 (Stokes 18, Dawson 3) Philander returns and Stokes takes a single, then Dawson gets off the mark with a pleasant tuck for three. 

9.34am EDT
09:34

40th over: England 122-6 (Stokes 17, Dawson 0) Du Plessis rearranged his field specially for Moeen in the first innings, too, and shonuff Moeen obliged then. What happened to the man who mustered that tremendous rearguard against Sri Lanka in 2014? 

9.32am EDT
09:32

Oh, sake; Moeen sweeps and top-edges straight to square-leg. On the one hand, he’s been playing shots; on the other, why play that one, then? Did he even know the man was there? It did not look like he did. “England, just giving their wickets away,” chides Athers. Updated

40th over: England 122-5 (Stokes 17, Ali 27) We have a quick run our review as Moeen sweeps for two...

09:29

“Simon, you’ve got to change your decision.” Ouch. Faf wonders if there’s enough evidence to overturn the decision, as there was a little murmur, but umpires have been told to look for a clear line. 

9.28am EDT
09:28

Back-foot edge ... Moeen reviews immediately. 

9.25am EDT
09:25

39th over: England 120-5 (Stokes 17, Ali 25) Philander replaces Morkel, but the Radcliffe Road, not the Pavilion. Stokes is basically walking him down, trying to make Philander change his length; will De Kock stand up? Not yet; maiden. 

9.22am EDT
09:22

38th over: England 120-5 (Stokes 17, Ali 25) A rare quiet over for South Africa, Maharaj struggling manfully to stem the flow of runs ... then, after just a single ceded from the over, Moeen drives its final ball, Morkel keels over but can’t stop it properly, and after some tricklage, England add four more. I’ve been sent a fair few messages checking that i was joking about Buttler and solidity - I can confirm that I was. “You can never be too sure these days; apparently Liam Dawson as a frontline spinner is deadly serious,” snarks Miles Dilworth. However, I would like to see Buttler given another go in Tests, and think the true tracks in Australia will suit him. 

9.18am EDT
09:18

37th over: England 115-5 (Stokes 16, Ali 21) Morkel squares Moeen up, only for Moeen to edge and see the ball race away for four. So Moeen restores the karmic balance, going back then leaning forward to drive on the up through extra cover - that’s a lovely shot, and it brings four. I smell a bouncer - and Moeen will too, I shouldn’t wonder. Here’s an email from Graham, harking back to the OBO community of yore: “Given that England are bound to lose this match before close of play, perhaps now would be a good time to give a shout out to Krakow Cricket Club. We’re always happy to host visiting teams and play on a lovely ground just by Wawel castle. This season we boast Jack Snape in the team, who won the village cup at Lord’s with Wimbledon not so long ago, and is a right big head.”Updated

09:14

36th over: England 107-5 (Stokes 16, Ali 13) England are stepping on the gas! Moeen sweeps four, then drives four, then sweeps four! At this rate, England might just get home tonight! He adds a single too, and that’s 14 runs from the over. 

9.12am EDT
09:12

35th over: England 93-5 (Stokes 15, Ali 0) Moeen is wearing a cable-knit tank-top to troll the Saffers, like when Derartu Tulu beat Elana Meyer in the 10,000m at the 1992 Olympics, wearing a t-shirt under her vest. Maiden.Updated

9.06am EDT
09:06

34th over: England 93-5 (Stokes 15, Ali 0) Stokes eases a drive past the dive of mid-off for four, so Maharaj tries a flatter, quicker one - he looks a fine, intelligent bowler I must say. But Stokes then stretches out to him, gets down on one knee, and flip-sweeps him around the corner for another four. England are stepping on the gas now. 

9.03am EDT
09:03

33rd over: England 85-5 (Stokes 7, Ali 0) Stokes slaps a pull for one, the only run from the over. By the way, sign up for this!

8.58am EDT
08:58

32nd over: England 84-5 (Stokes 6, Ali 0) Maharaj races through a taxing maiden; the fifth ball seems to catch an edge and fly up to the vacant backward short leg. A replay shows that it came off the pad, but a man is inserted there nonetheless. 

8.56am EDT
08:56

31st over: England 84-5 (Stokes 6, Ali 0) Don’t know about droppings. Bairstow deserves banning for a match after that shot. Maybe England can stick Root at three, then bring Buttler in to give some solidity to things. Anyway, Morkel directs a vicious, spitting bouncer towards Stokes’ throat, rattling the glove of his top hand as he fences. Christ.“Don’t know about droppings,” tweets SanMiguelMalaga. “Bairstow deserves banning for a match after that shot.” I suppose we can say well, the match was already over. The real culpability came on Saturday. Updated

8.50am EDT
08:50

It’s retro day again! Welcome to the 90s! Bairstow uses his feet to get to the pitch, looking to hit Maharaj over the top, and instead plops a catch directly to long on to enshrine a classic “that’s just the way I play” moment. Not when you’re 84-4 chasing 476, with five sessions left in the match it isn’t.Updated
at 9.24am EDT


8.47am EDT
08:47

29th over: England 83-4 (Bairstow 16, Stokes 5) Morkel takes the ball and rams one into Bairstow’s thigh-pad. Bairstow then follows one around his pads, but can’t quite apply the edge that will send him on his merry way. Instead, he flicks the final delivery for four through midwicket. “Root’s dislike of Rashid isn’t personal,” reassures John Starbuck, “it’s because he’s prejudiced against wrist-spinners, who leak more runs but take more wickets than the offies. As a batsman himself, the prospect of having to score more is unwelcome.”I’m not sure about that - I’d imagine he might also consider who and what he’d fancy facing. Maybe he doesn’t deem Rashid’s risk worth the potential reward, but if the batsmen do their job properly they can afford a luxury leg-spinner. 

8.41am EDT
08:41

The players are back with us. Morkel is vigorously warming himself. 

8.41am EDT

A couple of years ago, I wondered if England should bring Eoin Morgan back into the Test side...Eoin Morgan needs another go in the Test team. Discuss.Not everyone agreed. But I agreed with myself, and agree with this thread too.Eoin Morgan should be playing Test cricket.Maybe 11 ODI centuries is as good an indication of international pedigree as scoring loads of runs against county attacks in April and May.

8.36am EDT
08:36

“On the Rashid/Root suggestion,” says Ian Truman, “I’d be interested just how much Root has played with Rashid over the last 5 years, I’d suggest he’s played with him more for the England ODI side (where we’d all agree Rashid has been pretty decent) than he has for Yorkshire. It just seems so odd given that Rashid is a good batsman in his own right as well.”He’s played Tests with him too - presumably he didn’t like what he saw. Which isn’t to say that i get it. 

8.32am EDT
08:32

“Well, this is going well,” says Guy Hornsby of

Brexit
 our proceedings. There was a really good stat on Channel 5 on the weekend showing how little England have bowled on the stumps. Now, I know that this doesn’t necessarily translate to wanting to nick batsmen off when shaping away, but surely Philander’s proved – like McGrath before him – that there’s simple value in making the batsman play. It’s death by a thousand cuts, as Atherton, Hussain et al will tell you when it came to the Ashes. Tall bowlers are all well and good but if you’ll never hit the stumps, where’s the pressure? Someone pass me the gin.”Agree with a lot of this, but Morkel has been great so far this series. The difference in this match - in mine - has been the batting more than the bowling. 

8.30am EDT
08:30

What a morning for South Africa! Philander was brilliant first up, then Morris and Du Plessis added fresh impetus before the initial impetus had even expired. Sometime this afternoon, this match will end, you’d reckon - join me after lunch to “enjoy” it.

8.03am EDT
08:03

28th over: England 79-4 (Bairstow 12, Stokes 5) Maharaj will bowl the final over before lunch, and he’s another who’s risen to the occasion - not just here, but at Lord’s. Bairstow uses his feet to take a single into the off side, which means three balls into the rough at Stokes - close by are two silly points. Stokes, though defends well enough, and thus ends another fantastic session for South Africa. Updated
at 8.29am EDT


7.59am EDT
07:59

27th over: England 78-4 (Bairstow 11, Stokes 5) Stokes allows Martin to hit his face, running the ball through third man for four and reducing the target fro 400 and something to a far more manageable 300 and something. This is a fine spell from Morris, just when England might’ve thought themselves relative safe - his performance does not show Mark Wood in a favourable light. So, who comes in and who goes out for the Oval? I guess I’d keep Wood and Jennings but bin Dawson and Ballance. 

7.54am EDT
07:54

26th over: England 74-4 (Bairstow 11, Stokes 1) Bairstow adds one with a sweep and then Stokes props forward tentatively, imparting an edge which cues strangulated shouts. Nasser points out that Stokes’ gloves are very low, inviting the ball to run up them for a catch when he should be booting it away. Silly point comes in, and a shove towards mid on averts the additional embarrassment of a pair.  “Not so long ago that Bairstow and Stokes added 399 against South Africa,” emails Peter Salmon; some of you might remember that he is in the pub. I’m not sure he’ll be getting served too many more.

7.49am EDT
07:49

25th over: England 72-4 (Bairstow 10, Stokes 0) Du Plessis has had a brilliant game here, from the moment he called correctly and was ballsy enough to bat. That bouncer was part of a plan he communicated to Morris last over, though the bowler did well to hold it back initially, then bowl it as quickly as he did. Wicket maiden. 

7.46am EDT
07:46

Well done South Africa! They decide to go short at Cook, who opts to take it on. Then at the last second he tries to pull out, by which time the ball is in front of his helmet - it’s brilliantly straight. Cook succeeds only in swatting it down the leg side, where De Kock takes a superb catch. Expect England’s demise to accelerate from here. Updated

7.43am EDT
07:43

24th over: England 72-3 (Cook 42, Bairstow 10) Bairstow twists one away against the spin, and it zooms for four through square-leg. Then, though, spooked by that one which flew in Maharaj’s last over, Bairstow presses forward tentatively and inside-edges onto his pad. That did not look secure, but it did the trick. 

7.40am EDT
07:40

23rd over: England 68-3 (Cook 42, Bairstow 6) Root is now inside the dressing room and looking glum; on the bright side, perhaps Cook is playing his way into Test form, and as non-captain. Tangentially, where do we stand on the name Faf? Does it accord pleasing notoriety, or the further nickname Bum? Maiden. 

7.35am EDT
07:35

22nd over: England 68-3 (Cook 42, Bairstow 6) When at the cricket, is it acceptable to drink fizz out of a pint glass? Asking for a friend, though at Lord’s last summer the kid in front cut out the middle man and just used the bottle. Maharaj is on and the ball is spinning, but without many close catchers; his final delivery pitches middle and leg, then pitches right across Bairstow! Dearie me! “I prefer Rashid to Dawson too, but do find it telling that Root, who knows him well, would rather do without, emails Mark Gillespie, quoting me back to myself.“1. How do we know, or why do we assume, that Root is the sole arbiter of who plays and doesn’t? I always had the impression that the team selection was a joint effort between selectors, captain and coach, with the selectors having the biggest say.2. Is the reality not that it’s Moeen, not Dawson, who’s been picked over Rashid? My thinking behind that being that the balance of the team was meant to be a “control” spinner plus a wicket taking spinner, and that neither Moeen nor Rashid could fulfill the former role? I’m clearly not suggesting that’s worked, by the way, but potentially that was the theory.”I’d say that in the end, the captain gets what he wants, because he’s the one taking the players onto the pitch and it’s pointless giving him a bowler he’d rather not bring on. Moeen is in the team for his batting anyway, no?

7.31am EDT
07:31

21st over: England 66-3 (Cook 41, Bairstow 5) Morris races in and Cook whacks him to square-leg - there’s a man there, so they only run one. On the balcony, Root looks pensive; he’s probably not found much difficult in his life, but here we are. Anyway, Bairstow adds a further single. 

7.26am EDT
07:26

20th over: England 64-3 (Cook 40, Bairstow 4) Cook plays for Olivier’s outswing, driving through cover; WinViz says South Africa are 100% likely to win this match. Cook takes a single and the field is pretty spread for Bairstow; that’s a little strange, given his score of 0 and the 406 more runs England need. Anyway, the first of those issues is quickly resolved via four down the ground. “I’m not for dropping Ballance,” emails Gareth Fitzgerlad. You just know Andy Flower will demand James Vince get another chance...That being said – why does Dawson need to be replaced by a spinner? Do we need four seamers and two spinners?”I agree that six bowlers are too many, but just can’t see how Ballance is a Test number 3, nor why we need to expend more time investigating. Updated

7.22am EDT
07:22

19th over: England 55-3 (Cook 35, Bairstow 0) There was nothing Root could’ve done about that ball - the tardiness of the swing meant that the shot he played was redundant. And the effect will not just be removing Root, but instilling fear into those who come after. As Phil Leotardo once said, “Decapitate and we do business with whatever’s left.”Updated

07:15

18th over: England 55-2 (Cook 35, Root 8) Things have quietened down out in the middle; England daren’t give anything away in this period. Presumably Maharaj will be on soon, and that will be the next test; in the meantime, Root turns away a single and Cook escapes by missing a pull entirely, while Holding complains that there are too many fielders saving runs and too few catchers. Cook rams the point home by edging four, in the air, to close the over. Updated

17th over: England 50-2 (Cook 31, Root 7) Cook has never scored more than 50 at Trent Bridge; you’d back him to beat that now. Morris is on, bowling to two slips and gully - “that looks a bit meagre to me,” says Mikey, far more melodically than I can type. root takes a single off the final ball of the over, playing it down into the off side and haring away. “I think that bowling replacements are better,” emails Matthew Doherty, replying to Neil Harris. “Rashid and Roland-Jones, with Woakes to return.”I prefer Rashid to Dawson too, but do find it telling that Root, who knows him well, wold rather do without. Roland-Jones is an unknown quantity - we cannot be sure he’ll come in and do the necessary, nor that he’s more likely to than Wood is to improve - and Woakes is out for the series. Updated

7.03am EDT
07:03

16th over: England 49-2 (Cook 31, Root 6) Philander is done for the now, and Olivier has the ball; he’s full and straight first up, so Root drives three to long-off; Philander has to chase to the fence. Small victories, people, small victories. Meanwhile, back in the middle, Olivier gives Cook one on his pads - you know the rest. Or, to put it another way, the next phase of the innings is upon us, and England daren’t lose another wicket. So they add four more instead, Cook onto the front foot to drive down the ground. He is in, and that’s drinks. Updated

15th over: England 38-2 (Cook 23, Root 3) Third slip is so close as to be wearing a helmet but Root is yet to require his services, presenting the face to run three through mid-off. A good omen: his bat is New Balance - if only, etcetera - which connotes One Bryan Robson, the original Captain Marvel. Sorry, that’s all I’ve got; I take no responsibility for any dislocating shoulder.“How many changes is too many? asks Neil Harris. “I reckon four are in serious danger of not playing the next test – Jennings, Ballance, Dawson and Wood. Cannot think of a case for keeping any of them.”I can think of one very pertinent one: lack of obvious replacements. Updated

06:52

14th over: England 34-2 (Cook 23, Root 0) Cook sends a leading edge looping towards mid-off ... and it drops just short. Philander has bowled 6.3 overs, of which 33 deliveries have landed in line with the stumps; he now has the best average of any bowler with 50 or more Test wickets. Cook then waves slightly away from his body, but makes decent enough contact, earning four to third man before tucking a couple off his hip. Huge over for England, six from it. Updated
at 7.04am EDT


6.49am EDT
06:49

13th over: England 29-2 (Cook 17, Root 0) Cook nurdles a single to deep-square as in my head’s ear I hear the whooping and hollering that will greet the breaking of this partnership, like when an away team scores in a European football match. Root defends confidently and grins at Morkel; “what are you looking at, butthead,” comes back the reply. Next ball, Root edges, but with soft hands, such that it drops short of second slip; just imagine his bedroom sensitivity. 

6.44am EDT
06:44

12th over: England 28-2 (Cook 16, Root 0) “The folly of having three left-handers at the top of the order against Morkel and Philander we can discuss for ever,” says Nasser, before elegising the brilliance of the bowling. As for Bazgaz, in his first 10 Tests he scored 1019 runs at 67.93; since then, in 13 Tests he has 479 runs at 19.16. Ahem. "

Has Winnie the Pooh done something to anger China’s censors? Some mentions of AA Milne’s loveable but slow-witted bear with a weakness for honey have been blocked on Chinese social networks.Authorities did not explain the clampdown, but the self-described “bear of very little brain” has been used in past memes comparing him to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.Posts bearing the image and the Chinese characters for Winnie the Pooh were still permitted on the Weibo social media platform on Monday. But comments referencing “Little Bear Winnie” – Pooh’s Chinese name – turned up error messages saying the user could not proceed because “this content is illegal”.Winnie the Pooh stickers have also been removed from WeChat’s official sticker gallery, but user-generated gifs of the bear are still available on the popular messaging app.Comparisons between Xi and Pooh first emerged in 2013, after Chinese social media users began circulating pictures of Pooh and his slender tiger friend Tigger beside a photograph of Xi walking with Barack Obama, the US president at the time.In 2014, a photograph of Xi shaking hands with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was matched with an image of Pooh gripping the hoof of his gloomy donkey friend Eeyore.In 2015, the political analysis portal Global Risk Insights said a picture of Xi standing up through the roof of a parade car paired with an image of a Winnie the Pooh toy car was “China’s most censored photo” of the year.China’s ruling Communist party is highly sensitive to comical depictions of its leader, particularly as Xi attempts to consolidate power ahead of a key party congress later this year. On Monday, many Chinese social media users were testing the boundaries of the restrictions imposed on the bear who groans “oh, bother” when things don’t go his way.“Poor little Winnie,” one Weibo user wrote. “What did this adorable honey-loving bear ever do to provoke anyone?”"

Jamie Murray ensured the family name will be on a Wimbledon trophy for the third time in five years as he and the former world No1 Martina Hingis beat the defending champions Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen of Finland 6-4, 6-4 to win the mixed doubles crown.After the painful end to Andy Murray’s title defence, it was left to Jamie to produce the goods and he and Hingis, the No1 seeds, duly clinched victory in 74 minutes.“I have to thank Martina for asking me as I wasn’t going to play mixed doubles,” Murray said. “When she texted me, it was an easy decision to play, she’s such a great player. Anyone in the locker room would have jumped at the chance to play with her. I really enjoyed the whole week. It’s a great achievement. Any time you win a grand slam, get your name up on the board again, it’s there forever. No one will take it away from you.”Andy Murray, notoriously nervous when watching his brother play, was lurking in the locker room during the match but was there to congratulate him soon after he came off court. “I just saw him there,” Jamie said. “He said he came in the middle of the first set. I think he just waited in the lockers. He said he didn’t watch it. I don’t know if he snuck a few points in or not.”With Murray and Watson on opposite sides of the net, it was a win-win situation for British fans on Centre Court, most of whom had stuck around after seeing Roger Federer clinch a record eighth singles title earlier in the day. And they were rewarded with a match full of power, angles, deft volleys and outstanding movement around the net, especially from Murray, whose net skills left the crowd gasping at times.Hingis was the runner-up to Kontinen and Watson last year alongside Leander Paes but when she dumped the Indian in favour of Murray, the Scot knew he had a great chance to add to his grand slam tally. Ten years after partnering Jelena Jankovic to victory here, this was his fourth grand slam crown in all while Hingis took her total to 23, five singles, 12 women’s doubles and six mixed, five of which have come since the beginning of 2015.The big-hitting Kontinen, the men’s doubles world No1, had his moments and Watson held her own but last year’s champions were always up against it with Hingis’s dipping returns perfectly complementing Murray’s sharp net play. After trading early breaks, Watson was broken for the second time at 3-3 and they closed out the opening set.Kontinen and Watson had two chances to break the Murray serve at 3-2 up in the second set but could not take them. A slightly mis-hit return from Hingis set up two break points for the top seeds on the Watson serve at 3-3 and they took the second to get the vital break as Watson hit a forehand into the net. After Hingis held to love, the pair saved three break points to serve out for the title.Kontinen said he and Watson had not taken their chances but they hope to team up again next year. Murray and Hingis have yet to discuss future plans but it seems likely they will defend their title next summer and they may even play together in the US Open later this summer.Hingis, who won the singles here 20 years ago, admitted she was “not used to no” when she asks someone to play mixed doubles. “Here, it’s always tough,” she said. “I understand in the past guys would have said no because they really want to focus on doubles only because it’s three‑out-of-five [sets]. This is the only tournament that still does it. It’s definitely easier to ask somebody at the other three grand slams and not Wimbledon. But I was definitely hoping for a yes.”As Jamie said: “It was a good decision by both of us.”"

The Wimbledon singles are over for another year. Garbine Muguruza is the women’s champion, while fresh-faced Roger Federer is the ruler of the men’s game again. Federer has made history again. Eight Wimbledon titles in the bag, now it’s time for him to win his 20th grand slam title. Next stop: New York. And with Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic nursing injuries, there’s maybe only one man who can stop Federer from rounding up his tally at the US Open. You know who I mean. He’s a Spaniard with a very big forehand and an obsession with perfectly ordered water bottles. Anyway, that’s all from me today. As ever, thank you for reading and emailing over the past fortnight. Bye!Updated

Roger Federer speaks. “It is cruel sometimes, but he fought well and he’s a hero, so congratulations on a wonderful tournament, Marin. You should be really proud. You had a wonderful tournament and sometimes you don’t just see great in a final. I’ve got to take more time off, I don’t know. I’m going to be gone again for the next six months. Better than winning this trophy is being healthy. I’m feeling great. The tournament I’ve played, not dropping a set, it’s magical. It’s too much. It’s belief that I can achieve such heights. I wasn’t sure if I was going to be here after last year. I had some tough ones, losing to Novak. I kept on believing and dreaming and here I am today with the eighth. It’s fantastic. It’s such a special court. So many legends have marked this court, the women’s game, the men’s game, mixed, doubles. From day one to finals day, Centre Court is always packed and it’s a dream to play here. I hope I can come back next year to try to defend the title.”

Marin Cilic speaks. “I never gave up when I started a match. That was my idea today. I gave my best and that’s all I could do. I had an amazing journey here. I played the best tennis of my life. I want to thank my team, they gave so much strength to me. It was really tough today and I’m hoping I’m going to come back here and try one more time.”

Roger Federer, 36 next month, has just won a grand slam without dropping a set. His second of the year. This isn’t normal. But he’s making it normal.

10.53am EDT
10:53

Roger Federer’s name is on the trophy here. He just needs to add the final few flourishes. History beckons. His heart is beating that little bit faster as he walks to the baseline to serve. Cilic, like a condemned man heading to the gallows, takes his place, ready to return. The sun’s come out at last. Of course it has. But Federer still needs some points. He loses the first, sending a backhand long. 0-15. But he steadies himself with an accurate serve. Another one makes it 30-15 and he gees himself up with some Swiss-German. He has two championship points when Cilic screws a forehand return off to the right. Applause. Silence. A missed first serve. A rally. It’s not over yet. Cilic finds the angles to force Federer to hit a forehand long. 40-30. Federer misses another first serve. There’s only one thing for it: a second-serve ace down the middle. That’s it! Roger Federer is the Wimbledon champion again! He looks very emotional, almost in tears, but he remembers that there’s a man who’s feeling a fair bit more emotional than him right now and he walks to the net to shake hands with poor Marin Cilic. It’s all over. Federer is the owner of an historic eight Wimbledon titles and a mere 19 majors overall. Take that, Rafa.Updated

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 4-5 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic is serving to stay in the final, although he in reality he left it spiritually a long time ago. He is, however, determined to make Federer serve for it. His fifth ace of the match sets him up for a rare simple hold, even though there is the blemish of a double-fault. Federer will serve with new balls for his 19th grand slam title. “Given this has been such an anti-climax, and is finishing so quickly, do you think they could ask Federer to knock up against one of those back-walls, so we get to see a bit more of him playing on centre court?” says David Wall. “Even he can only have a couple more years on the tour and it’ll leave an enormous hole when he does retire.”Updated

Third set: Cilic 3-6, 1-6, 3-5 Federer* (*denotes server): There’s rain in the south-west London area, but it’s not going to stop Federer. Another hold. Another step closer.Updated

10.42am EDT
10:42

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 3-4 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic sends down an ace to make it 15-0, but it’s 15-30 when he flicks a backhand wide. He challenges to no avail. Then he nets a forehand, even though Federer was stranded on the baseline. Two break points. They double up as championship points. And it really is Federer’s to lose now. Cilic wheels into another forehand ... and dumps it into that blasted net. Federer is two games away from his eighth Wimbledon title.

10.38am EDT
10:38

Third set: Cilic 3-6, 1-6, 3-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer sails through another service game. It feels as though Cilic’s best hope is a tie-break.

10.36am EDT
10:36

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 3-2 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic holds with an ace out wide. He clenches his fist, glaring at his box, resolve and steel returning. You forget athletes are humans with real emotions. The sport of tennis is so hard because you're out there all by yourself.Updated
at 10.44am EDT


10.33am EDT
10:33

Third set: Cilic 3-6, 1-6, 2-2 Federer* (*denotes server): He’s obviously not winning this and it’s a terrible final, but I’d say Cilic has done a lot to enhance his reputation in the past few games. It would have been very easy for him to throw in the towel. But Federer’s still so miserly, scrooge-like when he’s serving. He offers Cilic false hope by letting this game drift to deuce - the drama! - but he still holds.

10.29am EDT
10:29

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 2-1 Federer (*denotes server): Alarm bells are ringing when Cilic spoofs a forehand into the net for 0-30. Somehow, though, he fights to 40-30, one backhand winner taking the breath away. This is gutsy from a man who is enduring some very public turmoil. Unfortunately the chap on the other side of the net is not making this any easier, making it deuce with a searing crosscourt backhand, earning a break point when Cilic nets a forehand. Admirably Cilic saves it with some serve-volley. Then he holds. This hurts, but tanking would hurt even more. “Is this a record for unforced errors?” says Henry C. “I feel sorry for Cilic but has got to be one of the worst finals ever. Hoping that something will change, but it is saying something when the first two sets lasted less than the Women’s final.”Updated
at 10.33am EDT


10.22am EDT
10:22

Third set: Cilic 3-6, 1-6, 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer lopes forward off a second serve, planting a deft backhand volley out of reach for 15-0. He holds to 15. No mercy. There’s no room for the stuff at this level.

10.19am EDT
10:19

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 1-0 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic holds to 15. The comeback starts here. It would be frankly hilarious if he wins this.

10.14am EDT

Marin Cilic is now receiving treatment. Though I’m not sure there’s a doctor in the world who can find a cure for Federer.

10.13am EDT

Marin Cilic has taken some pills. There hasn’t been a retirement in a Wimbledon final since 1911. Cilic is now having tape taken off his left foot, revealing it to be heavily bruised.Updated

Federer leads 15-0 when Cilic sends a forehand return wide. It’s 30-0 when he attacks a short return with a whipped forehand. Soon he has three set points. He takes the first with a swinging ace down the middle. I don’t mean to be insensitive, but this is the worst men’s final for a long time. The doctor is back on court.Updated

10.10am EDT
10:10

Second set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-5 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic is now using serve-and-volley on every point, which is enough to make you think he isn’t interested in long rallies. He’s drawn into one at 40-30, though, and he nets a forehand for deuce. Federer’s not going to give him anything now. He gives a second serve the treatment, a sweet backhand return earning him a break point. Federer can’t take it, though, knocking a return miles wide and challenging the call for absolutely no reason at all. But when Cilic sends down an 134mph serve, Federer’s flicked return brings up a second break point. Federer knocks a backhand down the line, the stretching Cilic hangs out his racket and volleys long. Federer will serve for a two-set lead. Updated

Second set: Cilic 3-6, 1-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Of course, it’s one way to get the crowd on your side when you’re playing Federer. The sympathy vote. It’s not going to knock Federer off course, though, as he holds to 15. They retreat to their chairs. There’s no sign of Cilic requiring any more treatment.

10.02am EDT
10:02

Second set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-3 Federer (*denotes server): Another cheer for Cilic when he wins the first point of this game with a big serve. The game goes to 30-all. The last time I saw something like this in a grand slam final was when Sabine Lisicki collapsed emotionally in the 2013 final. It’s not clear if he’s distressed or physically hurting. But he does manage to hold to 30, keeping this final alive.Updated

9.59am EDT

The medical team and supervisors have left the court. It seems that Cilic, who was bawling his eyes out a moment or two ago, is going to continue. He doesn’t want this to end early. But this is awful to see, even though he’s given a huge ovation by the crowd as he prepares to serve.Updated

Second set: Cilic 3-6, 0-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Cilic can barely do anything right now. Federer holds to 15 and all he has to do at the moment is wait for Cilic to miss. 

9.54am EDT
09:54

Second set: Cilic* 3-6, 0-2 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic makes himself feel a bit better with an ace for 30-15. It’s not long before Federer has a break point, though, with Cilic’s game in danger of coming apart at the seams. The errors keep on coming. Cilic pulls a backhand wide and Federer leads by a set and a break.

9.50am EDT
09:50

Second set: Cilic 3-6, 0-1 Federer* (*denotes server): The good news for Marin Cilic is that this isn’t over yet. The bad news is that Federer hasn’t lost a grand slam match from a set up since the 2014 Wimbledon final. He’s such a strong frontrunner. That’s probably why Cilic hit his chair with his racket during the changeover. He suspects this final might already be running away from him. Federer begins the set with a straightforward hold to love.Updated
at 9.59am EDT


9.47am EDT
09:47

Serving to stay in the set, Cilic’s pulled back to 30-all from 30-0. He decides it’s time to serve and volley, but he sets Federer up for a backhand pass, which is a bit like showing Leo Messi on to his left foot. Set point. A big serve forces Federer to return wide, but an errant forehand from Cilic brings up a second set point. Cilic is showing signs of strain. He misses a first serve. His second serve clips the top of the net and skitters wide to gift Federer the first set! That was all a bit flat.Updated

9.40am EDT
09:40

First set: Cilic* 3-4 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic gambols into a 40-0 lead. Federer makes it 40-15 with a crisp forehand return down the line, then 40-30 with a preposterous, hypnotic backhand drop shot that draws a deeply satisfied sigh from the crowd. Suddenly there’s uncertainty in Cilic. From a position of dominance, it’s deuce after a double-fault, the class of Federer unsettling the Croatian. Fortunately for Cilic, Federer can’t take advantage. He holds to keep the distance between them to a single break.Updated
at 3.20am EDT


9.35am EDT
09:35

First set: Cilic 2-4 Federer* (*denotes server): With Federer ahead, Cilic looks to haul himself back into the set with some aggressive hitting. Federer’s backhand slice seems to head wide - it’s called out - but the umpire overrules the line judge. The point’s replayed, Federer skips into a 15-0 lead and it’s 40-0 before Cilic has time to regroup. Federer clinches his first hold to love without any problems at all in the end, but that could have been a much tougher game.

9.32am EDT
09:32

First set: Cilic* 2-3 Federer (*denotes server): Trailing 0-15, Cilic goes for a drop shot. Federer reads it. The 35-year-old springs forward to dink. Cilic hurtles forward, prods a backhand from left to right and falls heavily, leaving the court open for Federer to dab a backhand away for 0-30! That exchange seems to take the wind out of Cilic, who’s facing three break points after an awful forehand. He saves the first two, Federer’s returns drifting long. Not the third, though. Cilic doesn’t move his feet and he nets a poor backhand to hand the first break to Federer. “Could the Prime Minister’s presence be a bad omen for fans of Roger Federer?” says David Wall. “She’s been poison for what seemed to be sure-things in recent times.” Will Federer end up shedding a solitary tear?Updated
at 9.37am EDT


9.27am EDT
09:27

First set: Cilic 2-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Cilic is starting to use his power to good effect, returning heavily and drawing an error from Federer for 0-15. It’s tense. Federer’s second double-fault of the match makes it 30-all. Hitting deep, Cilic is starting to boss a few rallies. A penetrative backhand makes Federer net a slice, bringing up the first break point. Federer nets a first serve. He goes for a body serve with the second, though, and Cilic stiffs a backhand into the net. The game goes to deuce and Federer ends up holding to considerable relief around Centre Court.

9.22am EDT
09:22

First set: Cilic* 2-1 Federer (*denotes server): You’d almost think Federer’s feeling the pressure. He’s missing a lot early on. Cilic holds to 15 without ceremony.Updated

9.19am EDT
09:19

First set: Cilic 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): We begin with a see-saw rally, Federer on top at first and making most of the running before Cilic takes control with a big forehand down the line, forcing the Swiss to net a backhand. A smooth serve makes it 15-all. But Cilic appears to have shaken off the nerves. He repels a big first serve and asserts himself with a huge forehand for 15-30. Sensing danger, the crowd cheers when Federer makes it 30-all at the net. The game goes to deuce after Federer’s first double-fault, but he holds. There’s a lot of nervous energy out there.

9.14am EDT
09:14

First set: Cilic* 1-0 Federer (*denotes server): Here we go, the 131st men’s singles final, with Marin Cilic serving first after Roger Federer elected to receive. It begins. Cilic sees a second serve rammed down his throat and dribbles a forehand into the net to make it 0-15. A purposeful, urgent start from Federer, while Cilic looks a little tight, slamming a forehand long to make it 15-30. The Croatian’s nervy. He’s grateful to see Federer miss a couple of backhands, but the game goes to deuce when Cilic slaps a forehand into the net. Here’s early pressure. But Cilic does well to deal with it and hold. A break there would have been sub-optimal.Updated

“I asked this about yesterday’s final as both women carried their own bags onto court (as well as their flowers), yet today the men are having their bags carried for them,” says David Wall. “Did Mugaruza and Williams just chose to carry their own gear then, or have they stopped offering that to the women? I think it’s a good tradition, they’re in the final so should get all the special treatment going (in fact I’m disappointed there aren’t rose bearers casting petals in front of the players for them to walk on).”I have no idea, David, but it’s a good question.

The players are making that familiar walk through the corridors of Centre Court. Well, it’s familiar for one man. Not so much for Marin Cilic. Cilic is leading the way here. They’re walking past so many photographs of old champions, so much history, so much pomp. The sense of occasion - it’s impossible not to feel it. It’s nothing new for Federer, of course, and he looks so relaxed. He’s seen it all before. Eventually they emerge to a huge ovation. The camera doesn’t linger long on Cilic, who’s smiling slightly. It’s soon fixated on Federer, following him as he makes his way to his chair, before finding his father in the crowd. Of course Federer Snr’s wearing a RF cap. Updated

Hello. It’s interesting. If you’re actually at Wimbledon, you don’t actually have to watch a Roger Federer match to know how it’s going. You don’t even have to listen the umpire calling out the score after each point. All you need to do is stand outside Centre Court and listen to the crowd. If they’re in a state of unbridled glee verging on pure lust, if they’re oohing and aahing and panting and fawning after every point, you can safely interpret that as Federer dominance. Enthusiastic applause: Federer’s won the point. Grudging applause: the other bloke’s not playing ball.This is how it’s supposed to go. This is Federer’s kingdom, his palace from palace. There’s no desire for him to be pushed too hard. There’s no interest in an upset. Sure, it’s nice to see Federer’s opponent muster some defiance, just to keep the show going for as long as possible, but he’s not actually supposed to win. He’s supposed to be a good boy, know his place, let the master do as he pleases and lose in straight sets. You are the comedy sidekick, there to be willingly loaded into a cannon, to have a custard pie slammed in your face and raise no objections; take it, it’s all you’re good for here. This is the deal. There might be some pretence from the crowd that they’d like to see something resembling a contest, some confected jeopardy, like a tie-break in the first set, which is really about as dangerous and adventurous as splashing out on the Creuset pan instead of the John Lewis own brand (other brands are available). The Fed-lust can only stand so much risk.Centre Court, in all its stuffy blazered glory, really just wants to bask in reverie for Roger. He’s nice like Tim, but he’s even better at tennis. Andy is stubborn and pretty brilliant, so he’s an excellent alternative. Novak is mysterious and brutal, but he can be a bit bad-tempered. Rafa is sweet and amazing and Spanish, a fine young man, ever so handsome, but he isn’t an artist. None of them turn up on court wearing a cardigan or a blazer - that’s true class. None of them are Roger. They love Roger. WE LOVE YOU ROGER. I LOVE YOU ROGER. MARRY ME ROGER. Did I say that out loud? Oh, what am I like!This is what stands in front of Marin Cilic today: Federer the player and Federer the legend. He isn’t supposed to win. It’s not that the seventh seed isn’t an interesting player, of course, or incapable of playing the kind of tennis that could urinate all over the eagerly anticipated Swiss coronation. It’s just that he isn’t Roger. Nor is the former US Open champion much of a character, a card. He’s just a guy who’s good at tennis. Unlike Goran Ivanisevic, the last Croatian man to win Wimbledon, there’s no Good Marin, Bad Marin and Emergency Marin. There’s just Marin. It might not be enough to win their affections.It could be enough to win this final, though. Cilic is playing excellent grass-court tennis this year and he crushed Federer on the way to winning the US Open in 2014. At his best, shorn of nerves and anxiety, he is a mighty proposition. If the 28-year-old doesn’t freeze, he could do something here. He was two sets up against Federer in their quarter-final last year. Underestimate him at your peril. But for all that it has been possible to catch a few signs of Federer frailty over the past fortnight, he still won that match and he still hasn’t really come close to dropping a set at this tournament. And last year he had that knee injury. This time he’s well rested, having worked out how best to protect his physical resources after that knee injury, and he’s been untouchable this year, playing quick, sharp-shooting, ask-no-questions tennis that is intended to kill the argument as quickly as possible. It’s brought him another Australian Open title, his 18th major, and titles in Miami and Indian Wells. It could bring him an historic eighth Wimbledon title.This is Cilic’s second grand slam final. It’s Federer’s 11th here and his 29th overall. He’s 36 in less than a month. This isn’t normal. But he isn’t normal. You wonder when it’s going to end. Is it going to end? You know what they want on Centre Court. More Roger. They can’t get enough Roger. And do you know? It’s because there’s nothing else quite like it.Play begins at: 2pm BST.Updated

The Wimbledon singles are over for another year. Garbine Muguruza is the women’s champion, while fresh-faced Roger Federer is the ruler of the men’s game again. Federer has made history again. Eight Wimbledon titles in the bag, now it’s time for him to win his 20th grand slam title. Next stop: New York. And with Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic nursing injuries, there’s maybe only one man who can stop Federer from rounding up his tally at the US Open. You know who I mean. He’s a Spaniard with a very big forehand and an obsession with perfectly ordered water bottles. Anyway, that’s all from me today. As ever, thank you for reading and emailing over the past fortnight. Bye!Updated

Roger Federer speaks. “It is cruel sometimes, but he fought well and he’s a hero, so congratulations on a wonderful tournament, Marin. You should be really proud. You had a wonderful tournament and sometimes you don’t just see great in a final. I’ve got to take more time off, I don’t know. I’m going to be gone again for the next six months. Better than winning this trophy is being healthy. I’m feeling great. The tournament I’ve played, not dropping a set, it’s magical. It’s too much. It’s belief that I can achieve such heights. I wasn’t sure if I was going to be here after last year. I had some tough ones, losing to Novak. I kept on believing and dreaming and here I am today with the eighth. It’s fantastic. It’s such a special court. So many legends have marked this court, the women’s game, the men’s game, mixed, doubles. From day one to finals day, Centre Court is always packed and it’s a dream to play here. I hope I can come back next year to try to defend the title.”

Marin Cilic speaks. “I never gave up when I started a match. That was my idea today. I gave my best and that’s all I could do. I had an amazing journey here. I played the best tennis of my life. I want to thank my team, they gave so much strength to me. It was really tough today and I’m hoping I’m going to come back here and try one more time.”

Roger Federer, 36 next month, has just won a grand slam without dropping a set. His second of the year. This isn’t normal. But he’s making it normal.

10.53am EDT

Roger Federer’s name is on the trophy here. He just needs to add the final few flourishes. History beckons. His heart is beating that little bit faster as he walks to the baseline to serve. Cilic, like a condemned man heading to the gallows, takes his place, ready to return. The sun’s come out at last. Of course it has. But Federer still needs some points. He loses the first, sending a backhand long. 0-15. But he steadies himself with an accurate serve. Another one makes it 30-15 and he gees himself up with some Swiss-German. He has two championship points when Cilic screws a forehand return off to the right. Applause. Silence. A missed first serve. A rally. It’s not over yet. Cilic finds the angles to force Federer to hit a forehand long. 40-30. Federer misses another first serve. There’s only one thing for it: a second-serve ace down the middle. That’s it! Roger Federer is the Wimbledon champion again! He looks very emotional, almost in tears, but he remembers that there’s a man who’s feeling a fair bit more emotional than him right now and he walks to the net to shake hands with poor Marin Cilic. It’s all over. Federer is the owner of an historic eight Wimbledon titles and a mere 19 majors overall. Take that, Rafa.Updated

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 4-5 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic is serving to stay in the final, although he in reality he left it spiritually a long time ago. He is, however, determined to make Federer serve for it. His fifth ace of the match sets him up for a rare simple hold, even though there is the blemish of a double-fault. Federer will serve with new balls for his 19th grand slam title. “Given this has been such an anti-climax, and is finishing so quickly, do you think they could ask Federer to knock up against one of those back-walls, so we get to see a bit more of him playing on centre court?” says David Wall. “Even he can only have a couple more years on the tour and it’ll leave an enormous hole when he does retire.”Updated

10.42am EDT
10:42

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 3-4 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic sends down an ace to make it 15-0, but it’s 15-30 when he flicks a backhand wide. He challenges to no avail. Then he nets a forehand, even though Federer was stranded on the baseline. Two break points. They double up as championship points. And it really is Federer’s to lose now. Cilic wheels into another forehand ... and dumps it into that blasted net. Federer is two games away from his eighth Wimbledon title.

10.38am EDT
10:38

Third set: Cilic 3-6, 1-6, 3-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer sails through another service game. It feels as though Cilic’s best hope is a tie-break.

10.36am EDT
10:36

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 3-2 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic holds with an ace out wide. He clenches his fist, glaring at his box, resolve and steel returning. You forget athletes are humans with real emotions. The sport of tennis is so hard because you're out there all by yourself.Updated

10.33am EDT
10:33

Third set: Cilic 3-6, 1-6, 2-2 Federer* (*denotes server): He’s obviously not winning this and it’s a terrible final, but I’d say Cilic has done a lot to enhance his reputation in the past few games. It would have been very easy for him to throw in the towel. But Federer’s still so miserly, scrooge-like when he’s serving. He offers Cilic false hope by letting this game drift to deuce - the drama! - but he still holds.

10.29am EDT
10:29

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 2-1 Federer (*denotes server): Alarm bells are ringing when Cilic spoofs a forehand into the net for 0-30. Somehow, though, he fights to 40-30, one backhand winner taking the breath away. This is gutsy from a man who is enduring some very public turmoil. Unfortunately the chap on the other side of the net is not making this any easier, making it deuce with a searing crosscourt backhand, earning a break point when Cilic nets a forehand. Admirably Cilic saves it with some serve-volley. Then he holds. This hurts, but tanking would hurt even more. “Is this a record for unforced errors?” says Henry C. “I feel sorry for Cilic but has got to be one of the worst finals ever. Hoping that something will change, but it is saying something when the first two sets lasted less than the Women’s final.”Updated

10.22am EDT

Third set: Cilic 3-6, 1-6, 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer lopes forward off a second serve, planting a deft backhand volley out of reach for 15-0. He holds to 15. No mercy. There’s no room for the stuff at this level.

10.19am EDT
10:19

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 1-0 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic holds to 15. The comeback starts here. It would be frankly hilarious if he wins this.

Marin Cilic is now receiving treatment. Though I’m not sure there’s a doctor in the world who can find a cure for Federer.

Federer leads 15-0 when Cilic sends a forehand return wide. It’s 30-0 when he attacks a short return with a whipped forehand. Soon he has three set points. He takes the first with a swinging ace down the middle. I don’t mean to be insensitive, but this is the worst men’s final for a long time. The doctor is back on court.Updated

Second set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-5 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic is now using serve-and-volley on every point, which is enough to make you think he isn’t interested in long rallies. He’s drawn into one at 40-30, though, and he nets a forehand for deuce. Federer’s not going to give him anything now. He gives a second serve the treatment, a sweet backhand return earning him a break point. Federer can’t take it, though, knocking a return miles wide and challenging the call for absolutely no reason at all. But when Cilic sends down an 134mph serve, Federer’s flicked return brings up a second break point. Federer knocks a backhand down the line, the stretching Cilic hangs out his racket and volleys long. Federer will serve for a two-set lead. Updated

Second set: Cilic 3-6, 1-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Of course, it’s one way to get the crowd on your side when you’re playing Federer. The sympathy vote. It’s not going to knock Federer off course, though, as he holds to 15. They retreat to their chairs. There’s no sign of Cilic requiring any more treatment.

10.02am EDT
10:02

Second set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-3 Federer (*denotes server): Another cheer for Cilic when he wins the first point of this game with a big serve. The game goes to 30-all. The last time I saw something like this in a grand slam final was when Sabine Lisicki collapsed emotionally in the 2013 final. It’s not clear if he’s distressed or physically hurting. But he does manage to hold to 30, keeping this final alive.Updated

The medical team and supervisors have left the court. It seems that Cilic, who was bawling his eyes out a moment or two ago, is going to continue. He doesn’t want this to end early. But this is awful to see, even though he’s given a huge ovation by the crowd as he prepares to serve.Updated

Second set: Cilic 3-6, 0-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Cilic can barely do anything right now. Federer holds to 15 and all he has to do at the moment is wait for Cilic to miss. 

9.54am EDT
09:54

Second set: Cilic* 3-6, 0-2 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic makes himself feel a bit better with an ace for 30-15. It’s not long before Federer has a break point, though, with Cilic’s game in danger of coming apart at the seams. The errors keep on coming. Cilic pulls a backhand wide and Federer leads by a set and a break.

9.50am EDT
09:50

Second set: Cilic 3-6, 0-1 Federer* (*denotes server): The good news for Marin Cilic is that this isn’t over yet. The bad news is that Federer hasn’t lost a grand slam match from a set up since the 2014 Wimbledon final. He’s such a strong frontrunner. That’s probably why Cilic hit his chair with his racket during the changeover. He suspects this final might already be running away from him. Federer begins the set with a straightforward hold to love.Updated

9.47am EDT
09:47

Serving to stay in the set, Cilic’s pulled back to 30-all from 30-0. He decides it’s time to serve and volley, but he sets Federer up for a backhand pass, which is a bit like showing Leo Messi on to his left foot. Set point. A big serve forces Federer to return wide, but an errant forehand from Cilic brings up a second set point. Cilic is showing signs of strain. He misses a first serve. His second serve clips the top of the net and skitters wide to gift Federer the first set! That was all a bit flat.Updated

09:40

First set: Cilic* 3-4 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic gambols into a 40-0 lead. Federer makes it 40-15 with a crisp forehand return down the line, then 40-30 with a preposterous, hypnotic backhand drop shot that draws a deeply satisfied sigh from the crowd. Suddenly there’s uncertainty in Cilic. From a position of dominance, it’s deuce after a double-fault, the class of Federer unsettling the Croatian. Fortunately for Cilic, Federer can’t take advantage. He holds to keep the distance between them to a single break.Updated
at 3.20am EDT


9.35am EDT
09:35

First set: Cilic 2-4 Federer* (*denotes server): With Federer ahead, Cilic looks to haul himself back into the set with some aggressive hitting. Federer’s backhand slice seems to head wide - it’s called out - but the umpire overrules the line judge. The point’s replayed, Federer skips into a 15-0 lead and it’s 40-0 before Cilic has time to regroup. Federer clinches his first hold to love without any problems at all in the end, but that could have been a much tougher game.

9.32am EDT
09:32

First set: Cilic* 2-3 Federer (*denotes server): Trailing 0-15, Cilic goes for a drop shot. Federer reads it. The 35-year-old springs forward to dink. Cilic hurtles forward, prods a backhand from left to right and falls heavily, leaving the court open for Federer to dab a backhand away for 0-30! That exchange seems to take the wind out of Cilic, who’s facing three break points after an awful forehand. He saves the first two, Federer’s returns drifting long. Not the third, though. Cilic doesn’t move his feet and he nets a poor backhand to hand the first break to Federer. “Could the Prime Minister’s presence be a bad omen for fans of Roger Federer?” says David Wall. “She’s been poison for what seemed to be sure-things in recent times.” Will Federer end up shedding a solitary tear?Updated
at 9.37am EDT


9.27am EDT
09:27

First set: Cilic 2-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Cilic is starting to use his power to good effect, returning heavily and drawing an error from Federer for 0-15. It’s tense. Federer’s second double-fault of the match makes it 30-all. Hitting deep, Cilic is starting to boss a few rallies. A penetrative backhand makes Federer net a slice, bringing up the first break point. Federer nets a first serve. He goes for a body serve with the second, though, and Cilic stiffs a backhand into the net. The game goes to deuce and Federer ends up holding to considerable relief around Centre Court.

9.22am EDT
09:22

First set: Cilic* 2-1 Federer (*denotes server): You’d almost think Federer’s feeling the pressure. He’s missing a lot early on. Cilic holds to 15 without ceremony.Updated

09:19

First set: Cilic 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): We begin with a see-saw rally, Federer on top at first and making most of the running before Cilic takes control with a big forehand down the line, forcing the Swiss to net a backhand. A smooth serve makes it 15-all. But Cilic appears to have shaken off the nerves. He repels a big first serve and asserts himself with a huge forehand for 15-30. Sensing danger, the crowd cheers when Federer makes it 30-all at the net. The game goes to deuce after Federer’s first double-fault, but he holds. There’s a lot of nervous energy out there.

9.14am EDT
09:14

First set: Cilic* 1-0 Federer (*denotes server): Here we go, the 131st men’s singles final, with Marin Cilic serving first after Roger Federer elected to receive. It begins. Cilic sees a second serve rammed down his throat and dribbles a forehand into the net to make it 0-15. A purposeful, urgent start from Federer, while Cilic looks a little tight, slamming a forehand long to make it 15-30. The Croatian’s nervy. He’s grateful to see Federer miss a couple of backhands, but the game goes to deuce when Cilic slaps a forehand into the net. Here’s early pressure. But Cilic does well to deal with it and hold. A break there would have been sub-optimal.Updated

“I asked this about yesterday’s final as both women carried their own bags onto court (as well as their flowers), yet today the men are having their bags carried for them,” says David Wall. “Did Mugaruza and Williams just chose to carry their own gear then, or have they stopped offering that to the women? I think it’s a good tradition, they’re in the final so should get all the special treatment going (in fact I’m disappointed there aren’t rose bearers casting petals in front of the players for them to walk on).”I have no idea, David, but it’s a good question.

It’s nothing new for Federer, of course, and he looks so relaxed. He’s seen it all before. Eventually they emerge to a huge ovation. The camera doesn’t linger long on Cilic, who’s smiling slightly.

Hello. It’s interesting. If you’re actually at Wimbledon, you don’t actually have to watch a Roger Federer match to know how it’s going. You don’t even have to listen the umpire calling out the score after each point. All you need to do is stand outside Centre Court and listen to the crowd. If they’re in a state of unbridled glee verging on pure lust, if they’re oohing and aahing and panting and fawning after every point, you can safely interpret that as Federer dominance. Enthusiastic applause: Federer’s won the point. Grudging applause: the other bloke’s not playing ball.This is how it’s supposed to go. This is Federer’s kingdom, his palace from palace. There’s no desire for him to be pushed too hard. There’s no interest in an upset. Sure, it’s nice to see Federer’s opponent muster some defiance, just to keep the show going for as long as possible, but he’s not actually supposed to win. He’s supposed to be a good boy, know his place, let the master do as he pleases and lose in straight sets. You are the comedy sidekick, there to be willingly loaded into a cannon, to have a custard pie slammed in your face and raise no objections; take it, it’s all you’re good for here. This is the deal. There might be some pretence from the crowd that they’d like to see something resembling a contest, some confected jeopardy, like a tie-break in the first set, which is really about as dangerous and adventurous as splashing out on the Creuset pan instead of the John Lewis own brand (other brands are available). The Fed-lust can only stand so much risk.Centre Court, in all its stuffy blazered glory, really just wants to bask in reverie for Roger. He’s nice like Tim, but he’s even better at tennis. Andy is stubborn and pretty brilliant, so he’s an excellent alternative. Novak is mysterious and brutal, but he can be a bit bad-tempered. Rafa is sweet and amazing and Spanish, a fine young man, ever so handsome, but he isn’t an artist. None of them turn up on court wearing a cardigan or a blazer - that’s true class. None of them are Roger. They love Roger. WE LOVE YOU ROGER. I LOVE YOU ROGER. MARRY ME ROGER. Did I say that out loud? Oh, what am I like!This is what stands in front of Marin Cilic today: Federer the player and Federer the legend. He isn’t supposed to win. It’s not that the seventh seed isn’t an interesting player, of course, or incapable of playing the kind of tennis that could urinate all over the eagerly anticipated Swiss coronation. It’s just that he isn’t Roger. Nor is the former US Open champion much of a character, a card. He’s just a guy who’s good at tennis. Unlike Goran Ivanisevic, the last Croatian man to win Wimbledon, there’s no Good Marin, Bad Marin and Emergency Marin. There’s just Marin. It might not be enough to win their affections.It could be enough to win this final, though. Cilic is playing excellent grass-court tennis this year and he crushed Federer on the way to winning the US Open in 2014. At his best, shorn of nerves and anxiety, he is a mighty proposition. If the 28-year-old doesn’t freeze, he could do something here. He was two sets up against Federer in their quarter-final last year. Underestimate him at your peril. But for all that it has been possible to catch a few signs of Federer frailty over the past fortnight, he still won that match and he still hasn’t really come close to dropping a set at this tournament. And last year he had that knee injury. This time he’s well rested, having worked out how best to protect his physical resources after that knee injury, and he’s been untouchable this year, playing quick, sharp-shooting, ask-no-questions tennis that is intended to kill the argument as quickly as possible. It’s brought him another Australian Open title, his 18th major, and titles in Miami and Indian Wells. It could bring him an historic eighth Wimbledon title.This is Cilic’s second grand slam final. It’s Federer’s 11th here and his 29th overall. He’s 36 in less than a month. This isn’t normal. But he isn’t normal. You wonder when it’s going to end. Is it going to end? You know what they want on Centre Court. More Roger. They can’t get enough Roger. And do you know? It’s because there’s nothing else quite like it.Play begins at: 2pm BST.Updated

The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, came face to face with his namesake as he met the baby of Syrian refugees who was named in his honour.The meeting took place at the Calgary Stampede on Saturday, where two-month-old Justin Trudeau Adam Bilan slept happily as the prime minister briefly held him.The boy’s parents, Muhammad and Afraa Bilan, named him as a gesture of thanks to the country that offered them sanctuary.The family came to Canada from Damascus in February last year, after escaping the Syria’s war. Their son was born several months after their arrival in Alberta.In December 2015 Trudeau greeted 163 Syrian refugees in Toronto, as the country prepared for thousands more arrivals. Since then 40,081 refugees have settled in the country.This has not come without its challenges, and the families who have been resettled have talked about the difficulties of finding work and learning English or French. Settlement agencies launched workshops to help refugees cope with the anxiety and some criticised the federal government for not doing enough for refugees.Speaking last year, John McCallum, Canada’s minister for immigration, refugees and citizenship, said the government had increased funding for language training to address shortages across the country. He said that while Canada’s ambitious project to settle tens of thousands of refugees was not perfect, it had gone extremely well. “And what makes me proud is not just that we got the job done, which we did – but there is still more to do – but really that if you compare Canada with other countries around the globe which are tending to close their doors to refugees, Canadians responded so overwhelmingly positively to the refugees.”"

JP Morgan just had the most profitable 12 months ever for a US bank – but it wasn’t enough for Jamie Dimon, the bank’s boss.“It’s almost an embarrassment being an American traveling around the world and listening to the stupid shit Americans have to deal with in this country,” Dimon told journalists after the bank released its latest quarterly results on Friday.The world’s largest bank reported a profit of $7.03bn for the second quarter, 13% higher than last year. It has made $26.5bn over the past 12 months, a record profit for a US bank.But Dimon, who last year turned down Donald Trump’s offer to become treasury secretary, seemed more concerned about low rates of growth in the US and the health of the American body politic. He blamed bad policy for “holding back and hurting the average American” and financial journalists for concentrating on the bank’s trading results when they should be focusing on policy.“Who cares about fixed-income trading in the last two weeks of June? I mean, seriously,” Dimon said after a reporter asked about the health of the bonds markets.“That is the weather,” he said of changes in the markets. “It goes up and down, this and that, and that’s 80% of what you guys focus on.”Dimon said financial journalists would be better off concentrating on the “bad policies” that are hurting average Americans.“It’s almost an embarrassment being an American traveling around the world and listening to the stupid shit Americans have to deal with,” he said. “At one point, we would have to get our act together, do what we’re supposed to do to the average American.”Dimon, who also heads the Business Roundtable lobbying group, which has been lobbying for tax reform and more infrastructure spending, set out policy areas he would like to see addressed.“We need infrastructure reform,” he said. “We need corporate tax reform. We need better skills and education. If we don’t focus on these things, we are hurting average Americans every day.“The USA has to start to focus on policy which is good for all Americans, and that is regulation, tax, education, we have to get those things done. You guys [journalists] should be writing a lot more about that stuff. That is holding it back and hurting the average American citizen if we don’t do it. “It’s not a Republican issue, it’s not a Democratic issue. Why you guys don’t write about it every day is totally beyond me.“I just got back from Israel, Ireland and France – three countries that deeply recognise the importance of having a business tax scheme for jobs and wage growth. We don’t have that.”Dimon lamented US failure to build an airport in the last 10 years and the opiate addiction epidemic.The JP Morgan chief has become increasingly outspoken on political issues since the election. In his letter to shareholders, released in April, he took some subtle – and some not so subtle – swings at the Trump administration. While Dimon clearly favours cuts to regulation, he argued: “Some regulations quite clearly create a common good (eg clean air and water).”Dimon’s letter was written as Trump began his attempts to dismantle Barack Obama’s legacy of environmental protections.Dimon also worried about the impact of “poorly conceived anti-trade policies” and wrote that it was “alarming” that so many talented immigrants were unable to stay in the US. “We are forcing great talent overseas by not allowing these young people to build their dreams here,” he wrote.The bank’s shares dipped slightly after the results were released but are still up close to 33% since the election of Trump. The results came as Citigroup and Wells Fargo also released better than expected quarterly results."

The former island paradise of Bikini Atoll is slowing blooming back to life, 70 years after the United States dropped 23 nuclear bombs on it, including a device in 1954 that was 1,100-times larger than the Hiroshima atom bomb. A team of scientists from Stanford University have been surprised to discover an abundance of marine life apparently thriving in the crater of Bikini Atoll, which was declared a nuclear wasteland after the bombings, with its 167 inhabitants relocated to other islands.Steve Palumbi, a professor in marine sciences at the university, said the effects of radiation poisoning on ocean life have never been studied in-depth, and his team’s initial research suggests it is “remarkably resilient”. Animals studied by scientists in and around the Chernobyl blast showed deformities and mutations, but the Stanford teams initial research suggest the marine life in Bikini may have fared significantly better. Palumbi’s team discovered a diverse eco-system of animal life in and around the bomb crater, including coral as big as “cars”, hundreds of schools of fish including tuna, sharks and snapper, and coconut crabs devouring radioactive coconuts on the shore. Palumbi said to the naked eye the crabs, fish and coral of Bikini Atoll look perfectly normal and healthy, and some of the coral has been around for decades – with evidence it may have begun growing as soon as 10 years after the last bombs were dropped.“The lagoon is full of schools of fish all swirling around the living coral. In a strange way they are protected by the history of this place, the fish populations are better than in some other places because they have been left alone, the sharks are more abundant and the coral are big. It is a remarkable environment, quite odd.” Palumbi’s team concentrated their research efforts on the coral and coconut crabs – which are the size of hub caps – because they have long-life spans, allowing the scientists to delve into what effect the radiation exposure has had on the animals DNA after building up in their systems for many years. Because fish have relatively short life-spans it is possible the worst-affected fish died off many decades ago, said Palumbi, and the fish living in Bikini Atoll today are only subject to low-levels of radiation exposure as they frequently swim in and out of the atoll. “This is the most destructive thing we have ever done to the ocean, dropping 23 atomic bombs on it, yet the ocean is really striving to come back to life,” said Palumbi. “The fact there is life there and the life there is trying to come back from the most violent thing we’ve ever done to it is pretty hopeful.”Even though plant, animal and ocean life is showing strong signs of recovery, humans are still unable to live and work on the atoll, besides a few caretakers who bring food and water supplies with them, and keep up the islands facilities. A United Nations report in 2012 said the effects of radiation were long-lasting. Special rapporteur Calin Georgescu, in a report to the UN human rights council, said “near-irreversible environmental contamination” had led to the loss of livelihoods and many people continued to experience “indefinite displacement”.The water cannot be drunk because of continued contamination, the seafood cannot be eaten, and plants cannot be farmed because of contaminated soil. More than half of the 167 original inhabitants of Bikini Atoll have now died, and many went to their graves still longing to return to their homeland. According to a paper by Timothy J. Jorgensen, associate professor of radiation medicine at Georgetown University, former residents of Bikini Atoll started showing cancers related to radiation exposure in the 1960s. Those down-wind of the explosions had burns and depressed blood counts. Those on islands further afield showed elevated risk for cancers, particularly thyroid cancers and leukaemia, and have been involved in a protracted compensation claim with the United States for decades. “What happened to the Marshall Islanders next is a sad story of their constant relocation from island to island, trying to avoid the radioactivity that lingered for decades,” writes Jorgensen. “Over the years following the testing, the Marshall Islanders living on the fallout-contaminated islands ended up breathing, absorbing, drinking and eating considerable amounts of radioactivity.”"

There’s an empty stretch of field off highway 141 in Colorado that used to be the perfect American town. Small houses with white picket fences boasted big flower gardens. Kids played kick the can in the streets, rode their bikes, splashed in swimming pools. On Sundays, they might have watched an Elvis movie on TV. The rent was cheap, the fathers all worked, the mothers stayed at home.Uravan was placid, friendly and, in most of the ways people usually measure it, safe. For many years, a former resident recalled, there was no law enforcement in the mining company town. Nobody needed it. The kids were good kids, because if they weren’t, the company bosses would kick their whole families out. The town, named after the minerals extracted and processed there, had secretly supplied uranium to the Manhattan Project during the war. Afterward, the cold war uranium boom made the town prosper. Things changed in 1986 when Uravan was declared a Superfund site contaminated by hazardous waste. The mine closed, residents moved out. The entire town – the trees, the houses, the post office, the Coke glasses from the drug store – was shredded and buried in a concrete-lined hole. The only thing left behind was the town’s metal flagpole, which was moved to the abandoned baseball field.“When they bury your whole town, they bury your history. There’s a little bit of shame to that,” said Jane Thompson, who grew up in Uravan. Her parents were the second to last family to move out.Thompson drove me through Uravan early one Sunday morning, pointing to the dip in the ground where the gas station had been, the block of houses where she had grown up. There was nothing left except scrub, battered earth and fences with signs warning, “Caution ☢️ Radioactive Materials.”Thomas and her family now live just down the road in Nucla, a shrinking rural town still dependent on the mining industry.Nucla became nationally famous when it passed an ordinance requiring every household to own a gun five years ago – a move that is still wildly popular among residents. But past Nucla’s one minute of fame, locals worry about their beloved home becoming a ghost town.In September, in the wake of a lawsuit from an environmental group, Nucla’s major employer, the local coal-fired power plant, announced that it would be shutting down in 2022. The coal mine that supplied the plant would be shutting down as well. In total, about 80 jobs were at risk – a huge number in a town whose population boasted, according to the 2010 census, only 711 people. For locals, this decision was a death knell brought on by liberals who live in big cities. Nucla residents bristle at the warnings about the risk of exposure to radiation, and roll their eyes at A-listers like Darryl Hannah, the Hollywood actress known for Splash and Kill Bill, who joined the activism against the local uranium industry. Liberals fighting against the mining industry are good at telling them no, residents say, but don’t present them with any alternatives – not ones that come with real salaries. Richard Craig, a former Nucla town board member, recalled a comment by a member of an environmental group saying during one of the contentious hearings: “Well, I don’t see why they don’t want to go live in the city.”“It’s almost like – I hate using this word, it’s being used so often – it’s almost like a conspiracy: ‘We need to move everybody out of rural areas and go live in the cities and suburbs,’” Craig said.Nucla made national headlines in 2013. That year, in the wake of the Sandy Hook mass shooting that left 20 first-graders dead, Colorado passed new gun control laws, banning the sale of new ammunition magazines with more than 15 rounds and requiring that private citizens perform criminal background checks before selling guns to each other. The laws were hailed by gun control advocates nationwide as a sign of progress despite the gun debate stalemate in Washington.Nucla moved in precisely the opposite direction: it passed an ordinance mandating that every head of household had to own a gun. Kennesaw, Georgia, had passed a similar ordinance in 1982. After Craig heard about it, he proposed the idea in a town board meeting. “It was kind of a joke to start with,” he said, sunk deep into the blue plush chair in his cluttered living room. But the reaction from other town board members was immediately positive. Nucla locals, who had been fighting with liberals for years over uranium and coal, loved the idea. “They said, ‘That sounds cool,’” he says. “I went, ‘Uh-oh.’”Craig received congratulatory phone calls from gun rights groups across the country, and the town took the national media attention in stride. Locals still talk fondly of the controversy over the town’s prairie dog shooting contest in 1990, which attracted dozens of animal rights activists and made the pages of People magazine. (During the shoot, the Los Angeles Times reported, picketers chanted “What are you gonna shoot when the prairie dogs are gone?” and a local woman called out: “Protesters!”)Craig himself saw the ordinance as responding to yet another irrational liberal attack on rural jobs. After Colorado passed its law on magazine limits, Magpul, a company that manufactures firearms accessories, left the state of Colorado in protest for Wyoming, where it reportedly expanded its workforce and secured a lucrative contract to provide ammunition magazines to the US marine corps. But he was dismissive of Barack Obama’s controversial analysis during his 2008 campaign that small-town residents “get bitter” and “cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them” as a way to channel their frustration. “The jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing’s replaced them,” Obama had said. “And each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are going to regenerate and they have not.” Craig maintains that Nucla’s love of guns is not rooted in bitterness. Even before the new rule was approved, most people in Nucla were already gun owners. The ordinance itself contains broad exceptions, not only for felons and those with a mental illness, but also for people who cannot afford a gun or simply wish to be “conscientious objectors”. This makes it more or less unenforceable.Still, Nucla’s commitment to gun ownership is no joke. There’s a tiny pink sign decorated with pistols at the local sheriff’s department – it reads: “We don’t call 911.” The town has no bars, no liquor stores, no movie theaters or malls, but it does have its own public gun range, free for use by all. The few local Democrats are no exception, including Craig himself and the local pharmacist, who was a prize-winning competitive shooter in college. Nucla’s historian, Marie Templeton, keeps a beloved gun her husband gave her as an anniversary gift. “I’m sure that the people who live in cities have no conception of what a gun means to a person in a small town like this. What do you use a gun for? Well, you kill rattlesnakes, for one thing!” she said. She got up from her kitchen table to fetch a stack of photographs of mountain lions and bears that had been spotted in her neighbor’s yard. The ordinance didn’t even faze Shirley Miller, an Englishwoman who moved from Essex to be with her American husband. She said her adjustment was easy for the most part. Coming from a small village to the east of London, Great Wakering, she finds small-town England and small-town America mostly alike, except for Nucla’s blazing, dusty summers and, of course, its bounteous guns.That aside, Nucla’s culture is not so different from small English villages, Miller said: the lack of diversity; the mix of open-mindedness and old prejudice among the residents. There have been small adjustments. She imports her Tesco and Yorkshire tea by mail, along with the occasional package of sultanas and Marmite, and each year she lets a friend’s sheep graze in the empty pasture by her house, adding a nice pastoral touch to the property. She refuses to say a word against the gun ordinance. People who live in cities have no conception of what a gun means in a side town like this“Although I come from a culture where there are no guns, and it’s different here, I don’t see the problem here in Nucla,” she said diplomatically. “If I were living in the city [these gun laws] would worry me. Here it doesn’t,” she said before adding wryly: “There is no crossfire here.”Even the town’s emergency medical technician – the major healthcare provider in the area during the night, when the local clinic is closed – said he carried a gun, as did the ambulance driver. The EMT, Jeff Stephens, said the ambulance had been held up twice.Last November, officials said, a heavily armed man with a history of anger at law enforcement opened fire on a sheriff’s deputy while he was driving in a remote area not far from Nucla. The officer returned fire, killing the man. A local prosecutor found the officer’s actions justified.But that shooting was an anomaly for the area. “Prior to that, the last violent shooting was in 1986 or so,” Stephens said, when a man tried to break up a fight between a man and his wife outside a bar in Naturita, the town next door, and was shot to death.Stephens said he does see occasional firearm accidents. There were two in recent memory: one a man shooting himself in the leg, another a young man shooting his partner in the knee. Both shootings involved alcohol, he said.Word travels quickly in a town of a few hundred people. I had given Craig, the architect of the gun ordinance, a call in advance of my trip to Nucla, and shortly after I arrived in town he tried to reach me on my cellphone. I didn’t immediately pick up, so Craig called the front desk of the hotel one town over, and a hotel employee dashed downstairs as I was starting to eat lunch. She handed me a fluorescent post-it note: it had Craig’s name and home number on it.By my third day in town, a woman stopped me outside of Nucla’s one restaurant, the Fifth Avenue Grill, to recommend someone for an interview. Had we met the day before? I wondered, confused. We had not. But she had heard all about me already. Later that day, a stranger in the burger joint one town over, a 1950s-style diner run by Seventh Day Adventists, broke into my note-taking to warn me that I had better be writing a nice story. I pulled up a chair to his family’s table. His son was just hoping the jobs would hang on long enough for his daughter to graduate from high school. Many of the residents were no strangers to the boom-bust cycle of the mining industry. It’s always been boom and bust, they told me, for the past hundred years. Sharon Johannsen, Jane Thompson’s sister, had been forced to leave town during a mining slump. Her family had only been able to return many years later, but her husband was now working at the coal mine that was slated to be closed.Many end up moving away for good, but the ones who stay or return are fiercely committed to the landscape and the isolation, the need for self-reliance. The nearest Walmart is more than two hours away. On the mile marker partway down the winding 100-mile road that leads to the closest hospital, locals have tied a pink ribbon to commemorate the place where a healthy little girl had recently been born.Grand Junction, that nearest larger town, has a population of just over 60,000. Several Nucla residents told me, with disgust, that they could not imagine living in a town that big, and some said they tried to visit as little as possible. Multiple men confided woefully that Nucla had a hard time attracting managers for certain jobs because their wives could not bear to live so far away from a shopping centre.Today, western Colorado is perceived as a conservative region. At a Blues in the Park night in Naturita, a stranger visiting the town, red-faced and somewhat inebriated, cornered me and began ranting about freeloading immigrants and American values. “This country wasn’t built by socialists!” he told me. “Actually,” I said politely, “this area, right here, this was built by socialists.” In 1893, a financial crisis devastated thousands of companies and caused the unemployment rate to spike above 10% for several years. Workers lost their homes and families went hungry. According to one history of the town, a group of Denver families who had become homeless and who were “united in their wish to escape tyrannical landlords” provided the impetus. In 1894, a group of 10 idealists in Denver formed the Colorado Co-Operative Company, with the goal of moving into the wilderness to create a new community – a place “where equality and service rather than greed and competition should be the basis”.The utopians spent nearly10 years digging an 18-mile irrigation canal through the arid landscape to bring water from the San Miguel river to the dry hill where they planned to build their colony. Money was tight, food scarce and the workers labored for shares in the eventual water rights in the canal they were digging by hand. To outsiders, the whole plan seemed like madness: how could anyone build a major irrigation canal without any capital? To expand their group of workers and supporters, the cooperative society established a newspaper, the Altrurian, to share news about their progress nationwide. It covered the day-to-day debates, including updates on the type of cabbages and lettuces that had been planted to feed the workers, as well as features on vegetarianism, marriage and violent labor strikes in other states. The paper advertised in-person cooperative club meetings across the country, including in Brooklyn, and was not too proud to beg for subscription pennies. “If you have received one cent’s worth of information from this week’s Altrurian, and are not already a subscriber, can you not afford to be a subscriber?” it prompted.When the ditch was finished, the utopians named their town Nucla after the word nucleus, a strange premonition of the town’s nuclear future. Socialism broke down only a few years later. In 1914, Nucla voted down its “single tax” system, in which the cooperative company owned all the land in town and paid one tax on it to the government, in favor of private ownership.Today, Thompson argues, it’s the labels on the town’s politics that have changed, more than the values themselves. The old-school cooperative mindset “really maybe has more to do with conservatism than we think: independent, not needing the government, not needing a landlord, not needing a boss or a big corporation”.The ditch is still owned and managed collectively by the Colorado Co-operative Company, which the utopians founded in 1894. It has about 170 shareholders, and in the summer, group meetings have to be held late in the evening to make it easier for local ranchers to attend after work.Monte and his son Dean Naslund have a strong connection to the ditch: five generations of their family have worked rebuilding and maintaining it over the years.I drove out with Dean late one morning, after the day’s first real work had been done. The ditch was unlined, just a channel dug in the dirt, 16-20ft wide at the top, carefully designed to flow downhill all the way from the San Miguel river to Nucla.Naslund stopped periodically to use a pitchfork to clear branches out of ditch gratings. The back of the pickup was filled with tools, mixed with old chunks of red-and-black rock – fossilized dinosaur bone, Naslund said. Golf balls sit near the front seat. He finds them “floating down the ditch – from Telluride, I suspect”.Golf balls aren’t the only trace of the liberal resort town that end up downstream in Nucla’s water. “There’s been a few people who say they found some other things from Telluride,” Naslund said, and paused. “Sexual endeavor things,” he added, delicately. Telluride, just an hour away, is Nucla’s polar opposite. The town, which hosts a film festival, is cosmopolitan and populated by the elite, a favored site for second or even third homes. Oprah Winfrey reportedly bought 60 acres of land there in 2014 and spent $14m on one of the town’s most lavish mansions (it has a wine cellar designed to look like a historic mine). To make ends meet, Nucla residents clean Telluride’s rental condos and help construct its elaborate mansions, with their enormous chandeliers and granite toilet seats and computerized bidets. One Nucla resident recalled walking into a bathroom in Telluride and feeling startled as “the toilet opened by itself”.The class tensions between the two towns are exacerbated by stereotypes. Telluride people think the small towners’ exposure to radiation means they “can’t think properly”, said Kyle Webb, a 28-year-old who had moved from Denver to Nucla, in part because of its gun ordinance. Meanwhile, the avowed environmentalists are building giant mansions with heated driveways to melt the snow. Telluride is “so wasteful – and it’s kind of hypocritical”, said Aimee Tooker, Thompson’s niece and the the president of the West End Economic Development Corporation, which was founded to help build new economic models in the area.“It’s the saddest thing. You know, we turn off our lights. And as long as we have a place to plug in our phone and our TV, we’re happy. Those people that are up there – they have rain sensors in their windows and sun sensors in their shades so that the shades will close automatically.“They’re the most wasteful people, yet they tell us that, you know, we can’t have our uranium, we can’t have this and that down here.” They’re the most wasteful people, yet they tell us that we can’t have our uranium, we can’t have this and that down hereThe two communities especially clashed during the push to reopen a uranium mill near Telluride, a raging fight that started around 2009. Hilary Cooper, a Telluride resident who was then the head of the Sheep Mountain Alliance, a Telluride environmental group, was one of the leaders who geared up to fight the uranium mill. “I kind of jumped into those communities thinking, oh, we can talk some sense into these people: all the medical research and how bad this stuff was for them and how bad it was for the environment,” Cooper said. She knew the environmental arguments might not be as powerful, even if she stuck to the simple talking points of clean air and clean water. “I could not have been more wrong in my approach,” she said.Her activism sparked outrage, and she said she received threats on her life. The children and grandchildren of Uravan miners had seen some of them die of lung cancer, but they never missed an opportunity to explain that they had been smokers too. The direct links they saw between exposure to uranium and cancer did not persuade them that uranium mining was a bad industry, especially with what the saw as more recent advances in safety. Thompson’s grandfather, who used to smoke and mine at the same time, had died of lung cancer. The local history museum has a photo of him smoking insouciantly while wheeling a cart of ore out of the mine. “If you had told my grandpa that he was going to die when he was 70 a horrible, painful death, he would have continued to mine,” Thompson said. “That’s how he supported his family and he was able to keep his family farm.” As an alternative to uranium, Telluride residents repeatedly suggested that Nucla and Naturita capitalize on the organic local food movement and return to their farming roots to provide Telluride and surrounding areas with produce, Cooper said.This suggestion was met with eye-rolling and frustration. “I’ll be the first person in line to pick your tomatoes for $45,000 to $75,000 a year,” one local reportedly said in 2009, contrasting agricultural wages with mining income. Years later, Thompson still scoffs at the mention of organic produce. Her grandmother grew her own food and canned it, and never used pesticides. “This is our way of life,” she said. After several years of angry public hearings, lawsuits and debates, the uranium project has been put on hold for economic reasons. In Nucla, where the spot price of uranium is printed on the front page of the newspaper, locals say it needs to reach $50 for the mill to be financially viable. The price listed on the paper in late June was $19.85. “Telluride says a lot of dumb things,” said Paul Major, the president of the Telluride Foundation, a community philanthropy. “You know, it’s easier to sit in Telluride and yodel about going green, and a community like Nucla is going, ‘What are you talking about?’ We’re just trying to put food on our table and a roof over our heads.””It was not easy for people working in information industries, or in tourism and real estate, to understand what it was like to be dependent on extraction industries, he said. If you had told my grandpa he was going to die a horrible,painful death at 70, he would have continued to mineThompson said that during a tour of Urvan for Telluride schoolchildren, their teacher asked her: “So how do you kind of live with yourself, knowing that the town where you grew up in is where the bomb came from that killed all those people in Japan?” Thompson said: “And I just looked at him, like, are you just stupid or are you just rude? What kind of question is that?“My grandfather was a farmer, he was a kind and gentle man that wouldn’t hurt a fly ... He had no idea what he was doing. None of them knew what they were doing.“I had a hard time with that man even asking me that question.” Cooper, who was recently elected as a county commissioner in a neighboring county, representing Telluride, said she has learned the limits of the town’s helpful suggestions. “Telluride is very well meaning in a patriarchal kind of way. We’ve got all kinds of ideas about what would be good for the West End. Unless it comes from within the West End, our ideas are not going to fly there,” she said. She thought some of the criticisms of the resort town have merit. “I, too, am frustrated with Telluride’s energy use and with the 19-bedroom second homes that are still consuming energy when nobody is in the house year round. That said, don’t let that stop a good idea from happening. Don’t use that as an excuse not to move forward with something that would help your community.”Lacey Steele, a Nucla native, has been commuting to work in Telluride since she was 15 and now works at a Starbucks there. At 21, she’s starting a family and getting ready to have a baby. “Everybody there looks down on it – young marriage and young families,” she said. She’s one of the only people at work who’s preparing to have children at all.She sees an imbalance of power even in the way the residents of the two towns think of each other. “I don’t believe that a lot of people in Telluride know what goes on around here. A lot of them don’t even know where we are.” And some of the work its millionaire tourist economy offers has real drawbacks: it’s seasonal, which means Steele is laid off twice a year in the spring and fall and then re-hired.Laura Denney, a Nucla resident who does private housekeeping in Telluride, said there is an “amazing difference” in lifestyles between the two towns. At the same time, she said, the families she worked for were “really down-to-earth people” who she saw give back to the broader community. She pushed back against the negative views of Telluride residents in Nucla. “A lot of people still have that feeling: ‘They’re just a bunch of hippies up there, just a bunch of rich people.’ You know what? It was the hippies that made Telluride rich ... If it wasn’t for the people in Telluride, a lot of us here in Nucla, Naturita and Norwood wouldn’t have jobs.”Residents of Nucla “do have this really strong attachment to their culture and their history”, Cooper said. Over the years, she’s come to believe that attachment is mixed with shame. The history of Nucla “is not taught in schools, it’s not shared ... There’s a conflict of being both ashamed and being proud of it – and I think in some ways that is what has really kept that community from discovering what’s next for them if it’s not uranium.”Jeremy Nichols, the climate energy program director at WildEarth Guardians, the not-for-profit whose lawsuit led to the closure of Nucla’s power plant, is unabashed about his goals. “We want to shut down all coal-fired power plants. We want to keep all coal in the ground. We have a moral imperative to confront the climate crisis, and we can’t afford to say, ‘It’s OK for this power plant to run and not the others.’”The scheduled shutdown is “an uncomfortable situation for sure for them”, he said. But the timeline, and the deadline, also have benefits, he argued. They provide certainty about something that was already going to happen, and cut through the rhetoric that might suggest, inaccurately, “that coal is great and it’s going to go on forever and if anybody says otherwise, they’re lying”.The town has to take responsibility for planning its own future, and for the lack of planning in the past. “It’s a beautiful landscape, but it’s stuck in an old economy, and the old economy is going belly-up, and Nucla hasn’t planned for that,” he said.One autumn 16 years ago, Monte Naslund, whose family has worked on the irrigation ditch for decades, was at cow camp, where cattle graze in the summer in the mountains near Nucla. It was always quiet up there, but on that day he noticed something different. The rumble of airplanes overhead, a constant background buzz even on a mountaintop, had stopped. He was listening to a depth of silence he had not heard since he was a boy.Only much later, when he came down off the mountain, would Naslund learn why it was so silent. Terrorists had flown airplanes into both the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and civilian flights had been grounded nationwide. More than 2,000 miles from the stunned New Yorkers who had watched the towers fall, Naslund had been able to hear the nation coming to a halt. Around Nucla these days, there’s a sense that many of the residents are listening intensely – that the seismic shift they are experiencing, as urban and rural priorities clash across the world, is audible to them. Some in town are optimistic that they will find a way forward: expand the Nucla airport for commercial flights, turn the old elementary school building into a hemp manufacturing center, finally mobilize tourism to Nucla’s canyons, rivers and bike trails. Others are doubtful that hemp will make much difference, and question whether Nucla’s natural landscape – beautiful, but without the show-stopping monuments of Moab or Zion – could ever become a true tourist destination. The town lies off the highway; it is not on the way to anywhere. Miller, who runs an Airbnb in her house, said the guests she gets stay for just one night, stopping over on their way somewhere else.Thompson, who is also the president of the local historical society, is doing what she can to celebrate the town’s more positive history. There is a Uravan reunion picnic every year to bring together old residents of the town. In 2012, the event had attracted an estimated 1,000 people. They served yellow cake in tribute to yellowcake (milled uranium oxide). In the fall, she’s planning to host an all-terrain-vehicle tour of the entire length of the socialist ditch. But progress on building a larger museum is slow and after years of effort, Thompson said that Nucla and Naturita still feel like an afterthought to the broader world, their culture and history less of a priority. “We really are a lower class people. I don’t know how to say that in a nice way,” she said.For Cooper, the Telluride commissioner, Nucla was founded with a pioneering spirit, and its residents still have it. “If they could tap into that and take advantage of it,” she said, “I think the sky’s the limit.”This article was co-published with Topic, a new storytelling studio.

Turkey also sacked nearly 7,400 officials in its latest round of purges against those allegedly involved in the failed coup attempt on the eve of its first anniversary.","Total number of state employees dismissed for alleged terror links reaches 110,000 as president prepares to lead ‘national unity marches’Associated Press

Turkish authorities have sacked nearly 7,400 civil servants for alleged links to terror groups on the eve of the country’s first anniversary of last year’s failed coup attempt.Thousands are expected to turn out for “national unity marches” in Istanbul and Ankara over the weekend, and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan will unveil the Martyrs’ Memorial on an iconic Istanbul bridge to remember those who died opposing the coup.“It has been exactly one year since Turkey’s darkest and longest night was transformed into a bright day, since an enemy occupation turned into the people’s legend,” Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said on Saturday in a special parliamentary session attended by Erdogan.Turkish soldiers attempted to overthrow Erdoğan’s government using tanks, warplanes and helicopters on 15 July 2016. The coup plotters declared their seizure of power on the state broadcaster, bombed the country’s parliament and other key locations, and raided a resort on the Aegean where Erdoğan had been holidaying. But the Turkish president had already left and the coup attempt was eventually put down by civilians and security forces.Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, used the first anniversary of Turkey’s failed coup to warn that any attempt to undermine democracy in one of the bloc’s was “unacceptable”.Stoltenberg paid homage to about 250 people who lost their lives resisting the failed attempt, praising the Turkish people who took to the streets and “stood up against this heinous act in defence of its elected government and democratic institutions”.He said added: “(I) still remember the shock I felt seeing the damage inflicted at the parliament building by the bombardments of the coup plotters.”The Bosphorus Bridge, now called the 15 July Martyrs’ Bridge, was the scene of clashes between civilians and soldiers in tanks. Some 250 people were killed and more than 2,000 were injured across Turkey. 35 coup plotters were also killed.Yıldırım thanked the thousands of people who heeded a call by the president to flood the streets and resist the coup.“We are able to come together again here today because of our 250 heroic martyrs, 2,193 heroic veterans and the great Turkish people. Your country is grateful to you,” Yıldırım said.In the aftermath of the coup attempt, Turkey declared a state of emergency that has been in place for a year, which has allowed the government to rule by decrees and dismiss tens of thousands of people. More than 50,000 people have also been arrested for alleged links to US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for orchestrating the failed coup, and operating other terror groups. Gülen has denied the allegations.The latest decree published on Friday evening sacked 7,395 state employees including teachers, academics, military and police officers, bringing the number of the dismissed to more than 110,000. The government calls the crackdown necessary to purge state institutions of those linked to Gülen, but critics say the dismissals are arbitrary and paths to recourse severely curtailed.15 July has been declared a national holiday.Public transport in Istanbul and Ankara is free over the weekend, and bus destination signs were displaying messages of congratulations.As on the night of the coup attempt, mosques across Turkey will simultaneously recite a verse, usually read before Friday prayers, to alert and invite Muslims to the streets."

Muguruza is now looking at her name on the champions’ board. She’s congratulated by her fellow Spaniards Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Manuel Santana before stepping out on the balcony.

The players walk off to a standing ovation, and their bags are being carried for them this time.

The Wimbledon suits will have had their hearts in their mouths there.

“Let the women play best of five,” emails John Rogers. “A final such as this ends too quickly. Imagine now going into a third set. Garbiñe wins and it is utterly emphatic. Or Venus wins and we’re into a fourth set where it’s all to play for.”

This afternoon was supposed to be about Williams writing an unlikely story for ages. But Muguruza hasn’t read the script. She hasn’t got any time for sentiment. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, as Muguruza hits deep and Williams hits into the skies. Three championship points. And some Hawk-Eye drama. Williams’s return is called out, the umpire overrules, and then Hawk-Eye shows the ball hit the line. They’ll replay the point. Muguruza nets. 40-15. Muguruza produces one of her most nervous shots of the afternoon, shanking out! 40-30! On the third championship point, Muguruza stops mid-point and challenges, what judgment, because Williams’s effort was long and Muguruza is the Wimbledon champion for the first time! She adds to her 2016 French Open title and after her defeat to Serena here in 2015, she now has got the better of a Williams sister in a grand slam final! Muguruza looks shocked - as does Williams - the Hawk-Eye challenge has robbed her of the chance for a proper celebration.Updated

Apparently the defending champion has been suffering from what she calls “FOMO” – fear of missing out - this fortnight. I’m not sure she’d like to take Venus’s place right now, though. Or maybe she would. She is the game’s greatest, after all. Make that seven straight games as Muguruza holds to 30 with a stunning point. The Spaniard is surging through this final now.

Second set: Williams 5-7, 0-3 Muguruza* (*denotes next server)The energy is flying from Muguruza now, while Williams looks flat. From 30-all, Muguruza gets a point for a double break when she threads a backhand down the line. Williams approaches the net but spoons a tired volley into the tramlines. Conchita Martinez, Muguruza’s temporary coach here at Wimbledon, applauds in the players’ box. Martinez is the only Spanish woman to have won Wimbledon having beaten Martina Navratilova in 1994 in what was Navratilova’s last singles final here. Navratilova’s age then? 37. Perhaps a bad omen for Williams. Or a good one for Muguruza, depending on where your loyalties lie.

Williams’s body language isn’t positive, she looks tired. But maybe she’s challenging the spirit of the Djokovic of old, playing a bit of rope a dope with Muguruza, because she then gets back to 40-30. But she undoes her good work with a cheap mistake.

You feel that opening set was more important for Williams to win, can she survive another two sets of this intensity against an opponent 14 years her junior? Williams has enough energy to get to 30-0, before Muguruza gets back to 30-all. Williams edges ahead again, 40-30, but she can’t shake the Spaniard off, deuce. And then it’s Muguruza’s break point. A backhand saves Williams. But then a ballooned backhand puts her in trouble again. A second break point for Muguruza. An ace from Williams. No it’s not! Muguruza challenges and it was out.

A wounded Williams takes the first point, 0-15. But Muguruza edges to 30-15. And then brings up two set points with a ridiculous get on the backhand side which initially looked like it was going long, but it loops over Williams’s head and plops in! 40-15. 40-30, after Williams fights back with a one-two punch. This time it’s Williams’s turn to display her defensive skills but after a draining duel she eventually nets! And Muguruza, having found herself two set points down two games ago, has taken the first set! And breathe.Updated

First set: Williams 5-6 Muguruza* (*denotes next server)“This is a brutal set of tennis, with both players seemingly trying to hit each other not so much off the court but out of SW19 altogether,” writes Guy Hornsby. “In many ways Muguruza is the heir to the Williams sisters’ power crown. This is shaping up to be a classic, but who will blink first? I feel Williams will want to finish this in two.”At 15-all, Williams’s shot is called out. She appeals to Hawk-Eye. It was well in. The point is replayed. But this time Williams rattles well long after some awkward footwork. 15-30, perhaps Williams hasn’t quite got those missed set points out of her mind. She recovers to 30-all but then clatters a forehand into the net. And from two set points up, she’s now break point down. Muguruza then shows her nerves with a shaky forehand. Deuce. Advantage Muguruza, after the Spaniard finds her forehand again. Some brutal hitting from both - they go at each other again and again and again, and Williams goes long! Muguruza claims the first break of this final and will serve for the first set! An error-strewn but compelling game. Updated

Konta couldn’t do it at 5-4 down against Williams in the semi-finals, can the Spaniard do it here? Muguruza is blown away by a brutal strike from Williams on the first point, 0-15. Williams tries to impose her will on Muguruza on the second point too but just goes long. 15-all. 15-30. 15-40 after a tame shot from Muguruza. A disappointing way to hand Williams two set points. Muguruza sends Williams from side to side but the 37-year-old keeps getting it back, before eventually fading with a netted forehand! That rally was 19 shots, the longest of the match. Muguruza saves the other set point with a strong first serve. Deuce. And now the Spaniard’s swinging. She takes the next two points to hold. Phew.

Only one more sexist hurdle remains: the right to play five-set grand slams. It’s time the organisers allowed women to do equal work for equal pay!”I’d certainly pay to watch that Sandra. The main issue may be how grand slam schedulers would fit in five-set women’s matches. One proposal would be to play best of five from perhaps the quarter-finals onwards. Though 37-year-old Williams may rather stick to three.This has been so close and competitive so far, it could come down to such small margins, as the first set did between Williams and Konta in the semi-finals. Muguruza holds to 15.

First set: Williams 4-3 Muguruza* (*denotes next server)At 15-all, Williams is like an octopus at the net, stretching one way and then the other. Muguruza can’t get past her so opts for the lob, which goes long. 30-15. Muguruza then biffs a backhand down the line, 30-all. 40-30, but then Williams throws in her second double fault of the day. At Williams’s advantage, Muguruza’s effort is called out but umpire Eva Asderaki-Moore overrules. They’ll replay the point. Williams slaps a backhand into the net. Deuce. Advantage Muguruza, her first chance to break. Williams nets the first serve, what can she do with her second? Her second serve has been so strong this tournament. Williams hits the serve deep - and Muguruza can’t get her return back into play. Deuce. Advantage Williams. A third double fault, Deuce. A big serve, Williams’s advantage. Game. A mixed bag from Williams on the serving front but she holds.

First set: *Williams 3-3 Muguruza (*denotes next server)A vicious body serve from Muguruza, a good tactic against the 6’1” Williams. 15-0. Williams scents an opportunity at 30-all, and she shows incredible movement at full stretch to ping a cross-court forehand winner! 30-40, the first break point of this final. Williams sends Muguruza one way and then the other, has the open court to aim into for the break ... and nets! A wry smile from Williams. Muguruza recovers with an ace and then Williams makes the error. Muguruza survives. We’re still on serve.Updated

First set: Williams 3-2 Muguruza* (*denotes next server)So both players have held serve fairly comfortably so far. This game is no different. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game. Muguruza is making a few too many errors on her forehand at the moment. Whenever I watch Williams play, I get rather embarrassed thinking about the first time I interviewed her when I was a rookie radio reporter. I was very nervous and was struggling to press record on my mini disc player (I’m showing my age). “Time is ticking,” she muttered under her breath without making any eye contact. The interview didn’t get much better after that as all 5’3” of me could barely stretch the microphone - which was wobbling so much because of my nerves - to her mouth. The interview lasted all of about a minute before we’d both had enough. Not my finest hour.

First set: *Williams 2-2 Muguruza (*denotes next server)It’ll be interesting to see who the crowd side with this afternoon. They do love an underdog, and even though Muguruza is the slight favourite with the bookmakers, she does almost feel like an underdog because of Williams’s experience. Early on, the support has been fairly even. Muguruza sprints to 30-0 on her serve, but then stalls her progress with an overcooked forehand. 30-15. Muguruza flirts with danger on the next point too but survives. 40-15. Game.

First set: Williams 2-1 Muguruza* (*denotes next server)You can really hear the pop, pop, pop of the ball under the roof as these two go at each other. At 30-15, Williams wallops away a forehand winner. Oof, take that. She thinks she’s repeated the trick on the next point, hitting deep into the corner, but it’s just out. Williams considers the challenge but then decides against it. 40-30. Then game.Updated

But the Spaniard steadies herself, getting back to 15-all and then ahead at 30-15. Muguruza charges forward on the next point and puts away a straightforward volley. 40-15. Muguruza goes back behind Williams, who manages to regain her footing and hit the ball, but Muguruza takes the point. Game Muguruza.

First set: Williams 1-0 Muguruza* (*denotes next server)The rain has eased off but now the roof is closed, it will remain so for the whole match. Muguruza has her left thigh heavily strapped, as she did during her semi-final win, not that it hindered her then as she charged past Magdalena Rybarikova for the loss of only two games. Williams starts as she means to go on, with an ace. 15-0. A longer point then plays out - you feel the longer rallies are more likely to be won by the 23-year-old Muguruza today - and the 37-year-old Williams whistles wide. 15-all. 30-15, as Muguruza prods long. Muguruza mishits her return and is a bit lucky to win the point, 30-all. 40-30. A brutal backhand down the line, and Williams is on the board.Updated

Muguruza says:“It’s very impressive [Williams’s longevity]. I think not everybody can do that. It goes a lot also with the strength of your body, your style of game. For me it’s incredible. I don’t think I could be 37 and playing that level. She just loves to play and she enjoys going out there. At least it’s what it shows. She keeps playing, even though she achieve so many things. She’s still motivated to go for more, which is also very surprising.”“[The 2015 Wimbledon] final helped me a lot to figure out a way to play better on grass because before I was, like, not very experienced. Never played a lot of tournaments. It was just a very surprising moment when you reach a final in a tournament where you thought it was going to be difficult. Right now I know how to play more on grass.“When I reached the final in 2015, and when I won the French Open, I could feel the difference between winning a grand slam and not winning. It’s a huge difference.”

Williams says:“There’s definitely [been] a lot of ups and downs [in her career]. I just try to hold my head up high, no matter what is happening in life.”“I love the big stage.

There are only a handful of players each year who can push and deal with the pressure of playing your best against the best players.“I don’t think about my age. It is not a factor. I just love the game and I don’t want this part of my life to end. It is not over until it is over.”

At the beginning of this fortnight, much of the talk at the All England Club was about the resurgence of a former champion reaching for another Wimbledon crown. But it was Roger Federer, rather than the five-time champion two years his senior who hadn’t won a grand slam singles title since 2008.In many ways, it’s surprising that Venus Williams wasn’t regarded as one of the favourites for the women’s title from the start. The 37-year-old has been a model of consistency over the past year, suggesting she has finally found a way of managing the auto-immune disease that she was diagnosed with in 2011 and that prevented her from being a contender for several years. She arrived at Wimbledon having reached at least the last 16 in her past five majors, including at this year’s Australian Open, where she lost to her sister – then eight weeks pregnant - in the final. So often has Venus been stalled by Serena in slams – six of her seven final defeats have been at the hands of her younger sibling – that Serena’s absence here removed one of her most familiar obstacles.However, Williams was burdened by the fatal car accident she was involved in last month, the details of which emerged only three days before the start of Wimbledon. Asked about the incident after her first-round win, she broke down in tears at her press conference. She struggled in the second round, coming from a set down to advance. That was the last set she dropped. Perhaps using her tennis as a refuge, she started to gain momentum. There was a certain symbolism to her victories over Naomi Osaka, Ana Konjuh and the recent French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko, who were all born in 1997, the year Williams made her Wimbledon debut. Then in the semi-finals, Williams had the look of a champion as she clinically ended the run of Johanna Konta.Now the only player standing between Williams and the title is Garbine Muguruza, who knows exactly what it’s like to lose to Serena in a grand slam final. The Spaniard was runner-up here in 2015 before securing her first major title at the French Open last year. A dip in form followed but she has rediscovered her touch this fortnight, under the guidance of her temporary coach Conchita Martinez, the 1994 Wimbledon champion. Muguruza, like Williams, hits hard, so this will be a match of few subtleties. Muguruza will know that much of the narrative surrounding this final is about Williams but she is more than capable of writing her own story this afternoon. The players will be on court at: 2pm BST. Do remember you can get in touch: via email or twitter.Updated

481,"Unidentified dead bodies are spotted floating almost daily in the Tigris river near the recently ISIS-liberated Iraqi city of Mosul, according to reports. The bodies are the evidence of extrajudicial executions of ISIS militants by the Iraqi security forces, non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch has alleged. Soldiers have shifted the corpses to a morgue at the city's general hospital.","Unidentified corpses are being fished out of the Tigris river, with human rights observers suggesting government forces are behind the deaths

The bodies washed up with grim regularity on the banks of the Tigris downstream from Mosul, a daily reminder of the vicious fight against Islamic State that played out a few dozen miles away.All were heavily decomposed, most bound and blindfolded, some mutilated. The corpses began arriving last spring, but as the mission to oust Isis fighters from the once-thriving city intensified, so too did the number of dead floating towards the west bank town of Qayyarah.“I see dead bodies in the water daily,” said Ahmed Mohammed, a driver, speaking earlier this year. “The number has increased since early April. There were five bodies floating in the river recently in one single day. They are young men with their hands tied behind their back and are blindfolded.”Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi this week declared victory after nearly nine months of fierce fighting to displace the extremist group from the city where it proclaimed its “caliphate” in 2014. But as Mosul lies in ruins – and the last women and children emerge from the rubble – a bloody picture of the campaign’s impact is emerging. Local people who spotted corpses midstream would try to catch them and then call the army, Mohammed said. Soldiers then take them to a makeshift morgue at the city’s general hospital, run by Mansour Maroof Mansour. Most of the dead found in the river with some identifiable features intact were young men who appeared to be in their late 20s, said Mansour, but he has learned little else about who they were. “We can’t identify the bodies in the river. They are very decomposed and there is nothing on them to use for identification,” he said, standing in a room filled with dozens of bodybags. None had been claimed, and even that toll of the unknown dead is not exhaustive; some bodies are lost.“(Once) the body of a boy also floated by but we could not catch it as it was too small and went through the gaps in the barrier,” said the driver Mohammed, who is haunted by guilt at letting the young boy drift away.Human rights organisations had raised alarm about the number of unsolved killings in and around Mosul city and in particular the corpses washing up along the Tigris river. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said evidence points to government forces, killing suspected Isis members or collaborators without trial or due process.Warning of the killings in April, Lama Fakih, deputy Middle East director for HRW said: “The bodies of bound and blindfolded men are being found one after the other in and around Mosul and in the Tigris river, raising serious concerns about extrajudicial killings by government forces. The lack of any apparent government action to investigate these deaths undermines the government’s statements on protecting detainee rights.”Little has been done to investigate the killings, however. “The horrors that the people of Mosul have witnessed and the disregard for human life by all parties to this conflict must not go unpunished,” Lynn Maalouf, research director for Amnesty International in the Middle East, said. The violence upstream casts a long shadow in Qayyarah, which was freed from Isis rule at the start of the nine-month Mosul campaign. Most residents are reluctant even to talk about the bodies in the river. “I don’t know anything about that subject,” said one fishmonger in the newly re-opened market, buzzing with soldiers and militia fighters.Isis exploited Iraq’s sectarian tensions to facilitate its rise to power. Many Sunnis who felt disenfranchised by the Shia majority government or feared becoming targets of security forces welcomed or at least tolerated the group’s arrival in 2014. As the extremism and violence of Isis world view became clearer, many Sunnis left or privately turned against the group, but suspicions of collaboration linger and in some Sunni areas a sense of apprehension remains.“Blood for blood,” reads graffiti on a wall of a house in Qayyarah that locals say belonged to Ali Khether, a well-known Isis commander who had lived in the town. He is described by one as “The child of adultery, Ali Khether, the Daeshi” – a name that refers to Daesh, a pejorative name for Isis.Close by stands the town’s small stadium where Isis, with the aid of local people, killed dozens, with the most cursory of trials, on charges ranging from spying for the security services to homosexualityNow as Isis retreats to the Syrian city of Raqqa and desert areas of western Iraq, those who were on the receiving end of their brutality for over two years have set up their own militia groups. Loosely attached to the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU), they are taking the law into their own hands.“PMU militias have carried out a systematic pattern of violations, including enforced disappearance, extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings and torture of Sunni Arab men and boys, seemingly in revenge for IS attacks,” said Amnesty International in a report earlier this year.Security forces who retook the town found the bodies of many Isis victims that had been dumped in the river, said Walid Khaled an officer at Qayyarah police station, but he had no idea who the more recent waves of dead might be. “We don’t know where they come from, they are unidentified,” he said.Some in the town say the bodies are more Isis victims killed by the last fighters holed up in Mosul, but the Iraqi security forces had blocked the river around 20km outside the city with a floating boom designed to stop fighters sneaking out or reinforcements getting in by water. Territory further down river towards Qayyarah has been in the control of Iraqi security forces for months.A soldier guarding a floating bridge connecting Munirah village, around 20km south of Mosul on the western bank, refused to give his name, but appeared to confirm that extrajudicial killings were taking place beside the river.He showed the Guardian a video of himself and other soldiers, dragging a limp body with a bloody face along the edge of the water. “He was Daesh hiding in the reeds and we killed him,” the soldier said with satisfaction."

Colombia has spent years trying to shake off its reputation as the cocaine capital of the world, but the country is producing more of the drug than ever before, according to new figures from the United Nations.An estimated 866 tonnes of cocaine were produced at clandestine labs across the country in 2016, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In 2015, the estimate was 649.In terms of the area planted with coca, the raw material used for cocaine, Colombia is back at the same levels as in 2001, when a huge US-backed anti-narcotics effort known as Plan Colombia was just getting under way. Coca crops covered 146,000 hectares in 2016, up 52% from 96,000 in 2015. Higher yields from mature plants mean more cocaine can be produced per hectare planted.The results of the study “show a complex panorama”, said Bo Mathiasen, the UNODC’s representative in Colombia.José Ángel Mendoza, the head of Colombia’s counter-narcotics police, said Colombia faced “a difficult historical moment”, but stressed that the figures reflected the state of the country on 31 December 2016.Since then, the government has put in place an ambitious plan to eradicate 100,000 hectares of coca by the year’s end. Half of that amount is to be forcibly eradicated, and the other half removed through crop substitution agreements with coca farmers.The substitution program is part of a peace deal with Farc rebels, who renounced drug trafficking as part of their demobilization deal. During much of the group’s 53 years as an armed insurgency, it financed its fight through the drug trade.Former combatants have committed to work with the government to convince farmers to replace coca crops with another way to make a living.“The history of drug crops is divided in two: before and after the beginning of the post-conflict period,” said Enrique Gil Botero, the justice minister.Already 40% of the goal of forced eradication has been met, and 86,000 families – who account for as much as 76,000 hectares of coca – have signed on to crop substitution programs in exchange for subsidies of about $11,000 per farmer over the course of two years, according to the government.“Having the Farc on the side of substitution and not on the other side makes a difference,” said Rodrigo Pardo, who heads the government agency in charge of implementing the peace agreement.But the deal on crop substitution with the Farc, announced before the final peace deal was finalized last year, also provided a perverse incentive for farmers to grow coca, knowing they would later be awarded subsidies. Cocaine production began increasing in 2013, rising steadily every year since. In 2014 the Colombian government ended aerial fumigations in over health concerns.A significant rise in the number of hectares planted with coca, the raw material used in cocaine, had already been reported by the White House, which uses its own measurements. While calculating 180,000 hectares of coca, the US figured the country produced about 700 tonnes of the drug in 2016."

Donald Trump doesn’t see the need for a proposed border wall to stretch the length of the roughly 2,000-mile (3,218 km) frontier with Mexico.Instead, he envisions “anywhere from 700 (1,126 km) to 900 miles (1,448 km) of see-through wall”.Trump’s comments on the wall are the most definitive description he has given on what became a primary campaign promise. During the campaign he vowed to oversee construction of a “big beautiful wall, with a big beautiful door” to let approved immigrants come into the United States.But on his way to Paris, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: “It’s a 2,000-mile border, but you don’t need 2,000 miles of wall because you have a lot of natural barriers. You have mountains. You have some rivers that are violent and vicious. You have some areas that are so far away that you don’t really have people crossing.”There are already about 650 miles (1,046 km) of fencing along the border, all of which is see-through.Trump’s remarks were informal and initially not allowed to be reported. The White House later provided a partial transcript of them.The Mexican border in much of Texas is defined by the Rio Grande, though parts of that river are little more than a trickle of water. About 24 miles (38 km) of the border in Arizona is marked by the Colorado river.Trump also said the wall “needs transparency”.“You have to be able to see through it,” Trump said, adding that border agents need to know what or who is on the other side of the fence to avoid being hit by sacks of drugs and other contraband.“As horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don’t see them. They hit you on the head with 60 pounds (27 kg) of stuff? It’s over,” Trump said.Drug smugglers have tried to fling bundles of drugs over parts of the roughly 650 miles of border that already has fencing or other barriers, using tactics including sling shots and catapults. But it’s unclear if anyone has ever been injured by the flying contraband.This year the government issued two notices for border wall proposals. The first called for a solid structure up to 30 ft (9.14 meters) high that couldn’t be easily breached. The second bid notice called for other types of walls, including something that could be seen through.Homeland security secretary John Kelly has said that border agents need to be able to see what is on the other side of a barrier for security and safety reasons. He has repeatedly said that Trump’s proposed wall would not be “sea to shining sea”, from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Gulf of Mexico in the east."

When Gokila's family learnt about their relationship, they disapproved of their relationship saying that Ajit was from a lower caste.   Gokila's family members allegedly warned her of grave consequences and also went to Ajit's residence to threaten him.AJIT KUMAR AND GOKILA ELOPED ON JULY 12Ajit and Gokila eloped on July 12 and got married at Marudhamalai in Coimbatore. Fearing that they could be killed if they went back to their hometown as they belong to different castes, they approached the Gobichettipalayam police station in Erode and urged the police to save their lives.The so-called Kongu belt, where the couple hail from, is infamous for incidents of dishonour killing that are reported at least thrice every year. Even after repeated pleas from many organisations and political parties from the state, no constructive policies have been formulated to abolish dishonour killings, forcing such couples to live in constant fear for their lives.Also read | Jharkhand: Man accused of raping, killing 8-year-old lynched by mobAlso read | Drunk man thrashed by mob in Trichy for kissing girl on road, arrested Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

Perhaps Federer didn’t look as effortless today as in the previous rounds here, but his numbers for 2017 are staggering. Since he took six months out last year for knee surgery, he’s won 30 out of 32 matches, claiming four titles including the Australian Open, and he’ll go into Sunday’s final as the favourite to beat Marin Cilic for another grand slam crown - but Cilic did beat Federer at the 2014 US Open en route to his only major title. Thanks for reading and do join us for the women’s final tomorrow when another 30-something will be looking to create their own piece of Wimbledon history.

A standing ovation for Federer, as the Wimbledon king holds court. The Royal Box join the applause, including Ken Rosewall. Federer’s now the oldest finalist here since Rosewall in 1974. As well as a record 11th Wimbledon final, it could be a record eighth title here and a record 19th grand slam crown. Roger does love a record.Federer speaks:I fell very privileged to be in another final. I’ve had the pleasure to play on Centre Court so many times, I almost can’t believe it’s true again. It was a long way back last year, it was difficult to stay calm and take time out. But I’m so happy I did it. Marin’s a great guy, I know him really well. I’m happy for him he’s in his first Wimbledon final. He crushed me at the US Open a few years ago, he played lights out. Ken Rosewall is a wonderful man so I’m happy he was here today.Updated

A huge roar from the crowd as Federer gets up from his chair and walks to the baseline. 15-0. 30-0. An even bigger roar at 40-0, three match points. Federer, perhaps a little overexcited, overcooks his backhand. 40-15. Game, set and match Federer when Berdych nets! Federer is through to his 11th Wimbledon final where he’ll face Marin Cilic!Updated

Third set: *Federer 7-6, 7-6, 5-4 Berdych (*denotes next server)Berdych appears to be doing that with ease. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0. But then it’s 40-30, with a wonderfully casual cross-court forehand-cum-squash shot from Federer. Berdych survives from there but his resistance could be futile. In 90 seconds, Federer will step up to serve for a place in the Wimbledon final.Updated

13:43

Third set: Federer 7-6, 7-6, 5-3 Berdych* (*denotes next server)How does Federer back up the break? With a love hold, of course. Berdych must hold his serve now if he’s to detain Federer for any longer.

1.41pm EDT
13:41

Third set: *Federer 7-6, 7-6, 4-3 Berdych (*denotes next server)Now it’s Berdych who appears to be dwelling on his missed opportunities. He slides 0-30 down before steeling himself to 30-all. Federer’s forehand volley brings up break point, 30-40. Berdych’s first serve slaps the net, his second goes to Federer’s backhand, which flies down the line and Berdych makes the error. Federer breaks. Surely Berdych has reached the point of no return.

1.36pm EDT
13:36

Third set: Federer 7-6, 7-6, 3-3 Berdych* (*denotes next server)Perhaps Federer can’t get that missed break point out of his mind. 15-30 on his serve, and he looks annoyed. Make that 15-40, two break points! Federer fends off the first and then aces Berdych down the T. Deuce. Another big serve, advantage Federer. Another one! Game Federer. That’s how to get yourself out of a 15-40 hole.

1.32pm EDT
13:32

Third set: *Federer 7-6, 7-6, 2-3 Berdych (*denotes next server)A giggle from the Centre Court patrons as Federer is caught off guard and has to improvise, putting his racket in front of his face to defend himself. But I’m not sure it had the finesse of a shot from Sachin Tendulkar, who the cameras zoom in on in the crowd. Federer recovers to give himself a break point at 30-40. He nets and, unusually for him, chides himself in Swiss-German. Deuce. Berdych wins the next two points to hold.

1.27pm EDT
13:27

Third set: Federer 7-6, 7-6, 2-2 Berdych* (*denotes next server)15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game Federer. No nuances in that game either. Perhaps they’re just stretching their legs before another tie-break. Updated

Third set: *Federer 7-6, 7-6, 1-2 Berdych (*denotes next server)Berdych holds comfortably. Federer is sniffling into his tissues at almost every changeover but the cold doesn’t seem to be hindering him today.

1.23pm EDT
13:23

Third set: Federer 7-6, 7-6, 1-1 Berdych* (*denotes next server)An “arrrrgh!” from Federer as he frames the ball, which then hits him. For all of his serene strokes, he does throw in some hilarious misses sometimes, because of his immense racket speed. Berdych holds to 15 before putting a little pressure on the Federer serve, 0-30. Federer snuffs out the danger with four straight points.Updated

Fancy some between-sets reading? Sure you do. Here’s Kevin Mitchell’s preview of the women’s final:

1.14pm EDT
13:14

... Federer balloons a return but he’s still 5-2 ahead and he now has two points on his serve ... a gasp as Federer loses the point for 5-3 ... but a cheer and standing ovation as he brings up three set points at 6-3 ... Berdych dismisses the first with a brutal forehand but meekly nets on the second! Federer’s 101st match at Wimbledon looks to be going the way most of the other 100 did. He’s a set away from a place in Sunday’s final.

1.10pm EDT
13:10

This is a must-win tie-break for Berdych surely. He hasn’t come from two sets down since 2005. The pair share the first two points on serve, 1-1 .. before Federer gobbles up an inviting second serve to grab the first mini-break, 2-1 Federer ... 3-1 Federer ... 4-1 Federer with a delightful forehand pass. That’s three forehand winners in a row ... make that four, well nearly four because Berdych gets a racket to the ball but he’s not getting that back into court, 5-1 Federer as they change ends ...

1.06pm EDT
13:06

Second set: *Federer 7-6, 6-6 Berdych (*denotes next server)That Berdych does at a canter. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game, as Federer nets the return. It doesn’t look like Federer was even trying on that final shot; perhaps he’s saving his energy for the breaker.Updated
at 1.17pm EDT


1.05pm EDT
13:05

Second set: Federer 7-6, 6-5 Berdych* (*denotes next server)You have to give credit to Berdych. He’s been under so much pressure during this match on his serve but he’s still taking it to Federer, moving the 35-year-old around with aggression and coming to the net whenever he can. Federer holds and Berdych must survive one more service game in this set to force the tie-break.

1.01pm EDT
13:01

Second set: *Federer 7-6, 5-5 Berdych (*denotes next server)Federer goes long on the first point. 15-0. But he shows his quick feet on the second point, adjusting his footwork after Berdych’s effort flies off the net to put away the winner. 15-all. A bad miss by Berdych, 15-30. Federer is possibly two points from a two sets to love lead. But Berdych isn’t entertaining thoughts of that. 30-all. 40-30. Game Berdych. If Federer and Berdych both hold serve again we’ll be into another tie-break.

12.58pm EDT
12:58

Second set: Federer 7-6, 5-4 Berdych* (*denotes next server)15-all becomes 30-15 when Berdych biffs long, and that becomes 40-15 when Federer nonchalantly flicks a backhand winner down the line. Wife Mirka nods approvingly in the players’ box. Federer comes through to 15, meaning Berdych must hold serve to stay in this second set.

12.55pm EDT
12:55

Second set: *Federer 7-6, 4-4 Berdych (*denotes next server)A rarity for Berdych, a hold to love. Back to you, Roger ...

12.52pm EDT
12:52

Second set: Federer 7-6, 4-3 Berdych* (*denotes next server)Federer’s forced to play two half volleys from the baseline on successive points. 0-30. Could this be Berdych’s moment? With Federer on the ropes, he comes out swinging, moving forward to the net. 30-15. 30-all. He allows himself a little fist pump at 40-30. Berdych sees Federer’s fist pump and raises it when the Czech gets to deuce. And advantage Berdych - break point - with a thunderous forehand! Federer waves his light sabre, with an out-of-this-world cross-court forehand winner. Deuce. Advantage Federer. Game Federer.

12.48pm EDT
12:48

Second set: *Federer 7-6, 3-3 Berdych (*denotes next server)Berdych could do with an easy hold here. He already has the gait of a man who’s been put through the mill. And he can only stumble forward before digging his racket into the grass when Federer volleys. 30-15. But Berdych has a little spring in his step when he takes the next two points to hold.

12.44pm EDT
12:44

Second set: Federer 7-6, 3-2 Berdych* (*denotes next server)That lengthy service game for Berdych is followed by another quick one for Federer, who holds to 15.

12.41pm EDT
12:41

Second set: *Federer 7-6, 2-2 Berdych (*denotes next server)At 30-15, Federer runs round his backhand to let rip with an inside-out forehand return winner. 30-all. Another punishing return, 30-40, the first break point of this second set. This time Federer can’t get enough on the return, it lands short and down the middle, Berdych steps in to dispatch the winner. Deuce. Advantage Federer, when Berdych nets. Berdych’s serve comes to his rescue. Deuce. Advantage Berdych, with some commanding net play. Berdych looks to have taken the game with a drive volley but Federer somehow skips far to his right, waves his wand, and conjures up a forehand pass down the line! Wow. Deuce. Advantage Berdych. Game Berdych, but Federer is asking a lot of questions.

Second set: *Federer 7-6, 1-1 Berdych (*denotes next server)Federer looks like he may carve out the chance for an early break in the second set at 30-all. But he frames his backhand return which seems to fly as high as the nosebleed seats. The fans in the (still not so cheap) seats kindly throw the ball back. And Berdych holds to 30.

Back on serve, 4-3 Federer ... and then it’s Berdych’s turn to throw in a bad miss, 5-3 Federer ... 5-4 Federer, who’ll now have two points on his serve to take the first set ... 6-4 Federer, two set points ... and one will do!

12.16pm EDT
12:16

First set: *Federer 5-6 Berdych (*denotes next server)At 15-all, Berdych cracks a forehand deep to Federer’s forehand wing, Federer just about gets it back, Berdych comes into the net, unwinds and ... nets! 15-30, could that prove to be a costly error? Federer challenges on the next point but Hawk-Eye doesn’t rule in his favour. 30-all. He’s all out of challenges already. For a man as talented as Federer, his judgment when it comes to making appeals is awful. But now it’s 30-40, break point. I was going to say chalk flies up on the break point as Berdych sends an ace down the middle. But it’s not chalk these days, it’s titanium pigment. Not quite so snappy, is it? I can’t quite see John McEnroe saying: “You can’t be serious! Titanium pigment flew up!” Deuce. Advantage Federer, a second break point. Deuce. And from there Berdych shows nerve to hold.

First set: Federer 4-4 Berdych* (*denotes next server)Of course Federer never sweats. That would somehow seem too human for a superhuman like him. But look here, he’s under a bit of pressure on serve for the first time at 30-all. And there’s a double fault! 30-40, break point. Berdych attempts the cross-court forehand pass but it barely makes the top half of the net. Deuce. But he makes amends on the next point with a winner from an almost identical spot. Advantage Berdych, a second break point. Deuce. Advantage Berdych, a third break point. And there’s another double fault as Federer’s second serve misses by a whisker! The Centre Court gasps. It’s not often you see Federer gifting the break point to his opponent like that.Updated

Berdych charges to the net on the next point, he doesn’t really give Federer much to aim into and Federer fires into the tramlines. 40-15. 40-30. Federer mishits the return but he’s lucky as it lands on the baseline and he then peels off a beautiful backhand winner. Deuce. But Berdych, sweat dripping from him already - his service games have averaged nearly five minutes compared to one minute for Federer - holds from there.@KatyMurrells all the Fed superlatives are used up but as my late dad used to say 'mother of sweet lanterin Jaysus this lad is some player'Updated

Federer’s putting in the hard yards on the next point too, he sprints to his left and attempts the pass but it doesn’t come off. 30-15. 40-15. 40-30. Some heavy cross-court hitting on the next point from a tight angle and it’s deuce. Federer slices and dices Berdych into submission on the next point, before finally ripping a forehand winner. Advantage Federer, break point. His second of the match. Federer looks to have set the point up with a deep return but Berdych recovers. Deuce. Advantage Berdych. Deuce.

First set: *Federer 0-1 Berdych (*denotes next server)Berdych is a big hitter so this is a similar match-up for Federer to his Raonic quarter-final. Berdych will have to be accurate with his serve and forehand today to avoid Federer manoeuvring him around. The Czech does that on the first point, quickly fizzing away a forehand winner. But he then lets Federer toy with him, and the seven-time champion pulls off the passing shot to get to deuce. And here’s an early break point. The pair battle it out from the back of the court and Federer blinks first. Deuce. Advantage Berdych. Game Berdych with an unreturned serve. It’s only the first game but that could be a big hold.

Here’s Simon Cambers’s match report from the first semi-final: 

11.25am EDT
11:25

Thump, thwack, thump, thwack, thump, thwack, they’re warming up. As for their head-to-head, Berdych will need to summon all the strength he can from the memory of that 2010 Wimbledon win over Federer, who leads 18-6 and has won their past seven meetings, including at the Australian Open and in Miami this year. “I thought the match we played [in Melbourne], I have probably never seen him playing better tennis,” Berdych has said. “Then I played him in Miami, I almost beat him, had a match point. Now for the third one, hopefully the luck [will be] for me.”Berdych has gone under the radar this fortnight, until the drama of Djokovic’s retirement in the quarter-finals. The Czech’s best performance probably came in last 16 when he downed the dangerous Dominic Thiem in five sets.

The players will be on court soon because Marin Cilic has reached his first Wimbledon final at the 11th time of asking, coming from a set down to beat Sam Querrey 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-5. The Croatian really has reasserted himself as a grand slam contender again after a quiet few years following his US Open victory in 2014.

7.32pm EDT
19:32

And then there was one. Well sure, there are actually three, but there’s only one member of the big four left, and he’s the one who’s going to win it, right? While Andy Murray limped, Novak Djokovic winced and Rafael Nadal was bundled out before his grass-court revival could gather any more pace, Roger Federer has spent this fortnight looking as serene as he did a decade ago when he was collecting all those Wimbledon titles for fun – minus the silly suits, gold-trimmed man-bags and cardigans emblazoned with RF. Perhaps the 35-year-old has a greater sense of humility and of appreciating the moment now, and if he were to win an eighth Wimbledon crown five years after his last it may mean more than any of the others, apart from possibly the first in 2003.The numbers for Federer this year and this fortnight are remarkable. His win-loss record for 2017 is 29-2. He’s won four of the six tournaments he’s played, including the Australian Open, his 18th grand slam title. He warmed up for Wimbledon by lifting the title at Halle for a ninth time. He hasn’t dropped a set on his way to the semi-finals here and has only been broken three times. And all of this after he took six months out last year for knee surgery. Perhaps the ailing Murray and Djokovic should take note.Today’s opponent is the Czech world No15, Tomas Berdych, who was the Wimbledon runner-up in 2010, when he enjoyed his best run at a grand slam, beating Federer and Djokovic before losing to Nadal in the final. The 31-year-old also hit the headlines in this country in 2015 when he was on the receiving end of a sweary outburst from Andy Murray’s wife Kim during a match at the Australian Open. “Flash fuck” appeared to be her choice words but “sitting duck” may describe Berdych today if Federer hits his recent heights. However, perhaps men’s quarter-finals day taught us to expect the unexpected.Updated

Two Israeli police officers have been shot dead and three gunmen killed during an early-morning shootout in one of Jerusalem’s most holy and sensitive sites.The attack – involving three Israeli citizens of Palestinian origin – took place just after 7am in the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif complex in Jerusalem. It began near the Lions’ Gate entrance to the compound, which is revered as a holy site by both Muslims and Jews.A few hours after the incident, the chief of the Israeli police, Roni Alsheich, confirmed the death of the two male officers from wounds sustained in the attack.The incident was among the most serious in Jerusalem in recent years and threatened to raise Israeli-Palestinian tensions. The two dead police officers were named as Hael Sathawi, 30, and Kamil Shnan, 22.According to police, the three men – residents of the Israeli Arab town of Umm al-Fahm who were armed with home-made Carlo machine guns and a pistol – opened fire on police near the gate before fleeing back into the heart of the compound which houses the al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock.Israel’s Shin Bet security service later named the three attackers as Mohammed Ahmed Mohammed Jabareen, 29, Mohammed Hamed Abd Al-Latif Jabareen, 19, and Mohammed Ahmed Mafdal Jabareen, also 19, noting that none had previous security convictions.Police security camera footage, released late on Friday, showed the gunmen approaching two policemen at the gate from within the compound - raising questions about how their weapons were smuggled onto the site.Two men with guns can be seen emerging through the low arched entrance and almost immediately shooting one of the policemen from behind as he is talking to his seated colleague.As other Israeli police pursued the men, a heavy exchange of gunfire took place, startling early-morning worshippers in the central plaza, some of whom recorded the shootout on camera phones.In the immediate aftermath the compound was cleared of visitors and closed, with police announcing that Muslim Friday prayers, usually attended by thousands, would be cancelled for the first time in 17 years.Israel said the site would remain closed until Sunday at the earliest while it continued with security assessments despite calls for it to be reopened.The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, condemned the attack in a rare phone call to the Israeli president, Benjamin Netanyahu, according to the Palestinian Wafa news agency.Video footage recorded during the attack showed shooting and police running across the central plaza in pursuit of the attackers.At one point, one of the gunmen, who is seen lying on the ground apparently motionless, is seen jumping up, amid a fresh exchange of fire in which he falls.A police spokesman described the beginning of the incident.“When they saw policemen they shot towards them and then escaped towards one of the mosques in the Temple Mount compound,” said Luba Samri. “A chase ensued and the three terrorists were killed by police.”Named after a Swedish submachine gun of the 1940s, the 'Carl Gustav' or 'Carlo' is the Palestinian nickname for crude automatic weapons produced in small workshops in the occupied territories.Designs and materials vary. A gun used in one recent attack had a barrel made from water piping while the moving parts are often mounted on already available stocks, including from paintball guns.While unreliable and inaccurate, the guns are much cheaper than black market weapons and Israel is increasing its efforts to find and close the workshops where they are made.The al-Aqsa mosque is Islam’s third-holiest site, while the seventh-century Dome of the Rock is also revered by Jews as the site of the historic temple. Jews are permitted to visit the site but not pray there, a prohibition supported by the mainstream Jewish Halakhic tradition. It is managed under a longstanding arrangement with the Jordanian-supported Islamic institution known as the Waqf.The last time the complex was closed off to Muslims was after the 2014 shooting of Jewish prayer rights activist Yehuda Glick, now a Knesset member for the Likud, while the last time Friday prayers were cancelled was in 1990. Netanyahu said in the aftermath of the attack that he would not change prayer rights at the site, despite calls by far-right politicians who sought to exploit the shooting.The deputy defence minister, Eli Ben-Dahan of the far-right Jewish Home party, had called for Israel to “bolster its rule and control over the [holy sites], and to ensure that all Jews can pray there at any time in safety”. A second Jewish Home MP, Moti Yogev, said the compound should be “closed to Muslim [worshippers] for a long time”.Netanyahu rejected the calls. “It was decided to shut the Temple Mount today for security reasons. Searches will be carried out to ensure there are no more weapons at the [site]. The status quo on the Temple Mount will be preserved,” he said.The grand mufti of Jerusalem, Sheikh Muhammad Hussein, told Palestinian news agencies he had been prevented from entering the complex. “We insist on reaching al-Aqsa mosque and performing prayers there. The occupation preventing us from praying marks an assault against our right to worship in this pure Islamic mosque,” he said.The incident follows a reported move by the Israeli government to allow Israeli MPs, who are not allowed to go to the flashpoint site, to visit the Temple Mount on a trial basis.Israel’s public security minister, Gilad Erdan, said: “The terror attack today is a severe and dire event in which all red lines have been crossed. The attack is still under investigation and will force us to look into existing security arrangements at Temple Mount and in its vicinity.“I call on all public figures to do all in their power to calm the situation and keep the peace.”A wave of Palestinian street attacks that began in 2015 has slowed but not stopped. Since September 2015, Palestinian attackers have killed 43 Israelis, two visiting Americans and a British tourist.In that time, Israeli forces have killed more than 254 Palestinians, most of them said by Israel to be attackers."

Steve Whitmire, the puppeteer who was fired after 27 years as Kermit the Frog has said he is “devastated to have failed” Muppets founder and his mentor Jim Henson.Whitmire has been with the Muppets since 1978, and took over as Kermit after Henson died in 1990. He wrote an emotional blog post in response to his firing a day after it was made public.He said he was let go against his will, and would never have left voluntarily.“For me the Muppets are not just a job, or a career, or even a passion. They are a calling, an urgent, undeniable, impossible to resist way of life,” Whitmire wrote. “This is my life’s work since I was 19 years old. I feel that I am at the top of my game, and I want all of you who love the Muppets to know that I would never consider abandoning Kermit.”For me the Muppets ... are a calling, an urgent, undeniable, impossible to resist way of lifeWhitmire said he was informed that Kermit would be recast in October, and has kept silent in the ensuing months in the hopes that he could get his bosses to change their minds. He said he offered “multiple remedies” to the reasons he was given for his firing.He would not say what those reasons were, nor would Muppet Studio or its parent company Disney, who have not responded to requests for comment from The Associated Press.Muppets Studio said in a statement to Time magazine that it “thanks Steve for his tremendous contributions to Kermit the Frog and the Muppets franchise. We wish him well in his future endeavours”.The Hollywood Reporter and ABC News reported on Wednesday that longtime Muppets performer Matt Vogel will take over as Kermit.Kermit was Henson’s signature character, and the centrepiece of the Muppets franchise from 1955 until 1990. When he died it was unthinkable for many to imagine someone else taking on the role.But Whitmire took up the job, and became the only Kermit many of today’s young adults and children have ever known.The two made TV appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live and in films like Muppets Most Wanted and The Muppets.Addressing friends and fans, Whitmire wrote on his blog: “I just want you all to know that I am sorry if I have disappointed any of you at any point throughout our journey, and to let everyone know that I am devastated to have failed in my duty to my hero.”"

HBO kept its place at the top of the Emmy nominations tree with its robot western series Westworld bagging 22 nominations at this year’s event, which saw it tie with the comedy show Saturday Night Live for the most nods.The haul amounted to one fewer nomination than HBO’s usual Emmy juggernaut Game of Thrones managed last year, and was a shock to some observers who predicted a more modest showing from a series that had a mixed reception upon its release.The show will battle it out for the top honour, outstanding drama series, alongside Better Call Saul, House of Cards, Stranger Things, The Crown, The Handmaid’s Tale and This Is Us. Homeland and The Americans missed out.Westworld also had a good showing in the acting categories, with Sir Anthony Hopkins and Evan Rachel Wood nominated for best lead actors and Thandie Newton and Jeffrey Wright recognised in the supporting actor categories.Saturday Night Live also received 22 nominations, including a nod for Alec Baldwin and his impression of Donald Trump, while Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Vanessa Bayer, were all recognised in the best supporting actress in a comedy series category.On Thursday morning in Los Angeles, the Veep actor Anna Chlumsky and the Criminal Minds star Shemar Moore read out the nominations. It was another diverse list following last year’s showing, in which actors of colour were nominated in all the leading actor categories – a first. That feat wasn’t repeated this year, with no actors of colour nominated in the best actress in a limited series or a television musical.Donald Glover’s Atlanta received nods for best comedy series and best comedy actor for Glover. ABC’s Black-ish is up for best comedy series, and its lead actors, Anthony Anderson and Tracee Ellis Ross, were both nominated in the best comedy actor and actress categories. Aziz Ansari’s Master of None is also up for best comedy, and Ansari for best comedy actor, while HBO’s The Night Of took 13 nominations.Viola Davis was nominated again for best actress in a drama series for her role in How To Get Away With Murder, and Sterling K Brown was nominated for best actor in a drama series for his performance in This Is Us.The only real shocks came in the best talk show category, where Jimmy Fallon missed out and Bill Maher’s Real Talk was nominated despite controversy surrounding the host, who used the N-word on the show recently. Samantha Bee’s Full Frontal was also included, while Jerry Seinfeld’s Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee missed out.Other shows that missed out were the Leftovers, which didn’t bag any nominations in the main categories, plus Girls and Transparent which both missed out in the best comedy series category. Mr Robot’s Rami Malek also missed out on best actor in a drama series despite winning in that category last year. Carrie Fisher was given a posthumous nomination for her role in Catastrophe."

The daughter of Pakistan’s prime minister has become subject of ridicule in her home country after forensic experts cast doubts on documents central to her defence against corruption allegations.Mariam Nawaz Sharif is under supreme court investigation after the 2016 Panama Papers leak tied her to a purchase of high-end London property acquired through offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands.The unlikely source of this latest controversy, in a scandal that has gripped Pakistan for more than a year, is a font designed by Microsoft.Documents claiming that Mariam Nawaz Sharif was only a trustee of the companies that bought the London flats, are dated February 2006, and appear to be typed in Microsoft Calibri.But the font was only made commercially available in 2007, leading to suspicions that the documents are forged.Social media users have derided Sharif for this apparent misstep, coining the hashtag #fontgate.According to Wikipedia, the online encyclopaedia, the Calibri font was developed in 2004 but only reached the general public on 30 January 2007 with the launch of Microsoft Vista and Microsoft Office 2007.The Wikipedia Calibri page usually receives about 500 visits per day. On July 11 and 12 combined, it received about 150,000.After users seemingly tried to change the article’s content to say the font was available from 2004, Wikipedia suspended editing on its Calibri page “until July 18 2017, or until editing disputes have been resolved”.One supporter hailed the move, saying people seeking to edit the page “are trying to save a corrupt political party on corruption charges”. Others praised Wikipedia for its quick response and said it was proof of the company’s integrity.Opposition parties have urged prime minister Nawaz Sharif to step down after the investigation found a “significant disparity” between his family’s declared wealth and known sources of income.Opposition leader Imran Khan said Sharif had “lost all moral authority” and must resign immediately.Sharif has denied wrongdoing and said his family’s wealth was acquired legally."

493,"The most resilient form of life on Earth, tardigrade, also known as water bear, will survive until the Sun dies, as per an Oxford University research. The eight-legged micro-animal can survive for 30 years without food or water, and endure temperature extremes from -270�C to 150�C. Further, tardigrades can withstand catastrophic events like large asteroid impacts, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts.","Microscopic creatures reassure scientists complete eradication of life on the planet is extremely unlikely Whether it is a supernova or an asteroid impact, should a cosmic calamity strike, it seems there will be at least one form of life left: a tubby, microscopic animal with the appearance of a crumpled hoover bag.The creatures, known as tardigrades, are staggeringly hardy animals, a millimetre or less in size, with species living in wet conditions that range from mountain tops to chilly ocean waters to moss and lichen on land.“They can survive incredible conditions – we are talking close to absolute zero, the vacuum of space, exposure to radiation that would kill us, and these things just walk away from it like nothing happened,” said David Sloan, an astrophysicist from the University of Oxford.Now new research by Sloan and colleagues has shown that the creatures would survive any cosmic disaster that might conceivably be thrown at Earth – a discovery that could have implications elsewhere in the solar system, and beyond. “There are quite a lot of stars like our sun out there, and about 20% of these stars have an Earth-like planet around them,” said Sloan. “What you then want to ask is if life started on one of these planets, what are the odds that it is still around?”Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, the researchers describe how they probed the conundrum by exploring the likelihood of a variety of catastrophes serious enough to wipe out tardigrades on an Earth-like planet, including a nearby supernova, a burst of gamma-rays, and an impact by a large asteroid powerful enough to cause the oceans to boil away. But the team found that the chances of such events were so remote as to be extremely unlikely – there was little chance of a supernova occurring close enough to an Earth-like planet to kill off the creatures, and it would take an impact from an asteroid or dwarf planet near the mass of Vesta for the oceans to boil. “There are about 17 [asteroids] this big in our solar system, but they are all on sufficient orbits that they will never intersect with us,” said Sloan. The upshot, he said, was that it was very unlikely any cosmic event would be so catastrophic as to sterilise an Earth-like planet where life, of the sort we know, had got going. “Because [tardigrades] are so hardy it means that events that we are worried about as human beings, and rightly so, certainly wouldn’t concern you if you just considered all life,” said Sloan. Matthew Cobb, professor of zoology at the University of Manchester, who was not involved in the study said the findings were reassuring for the future of life on Earth.“It suggests that the complete eradication of life on Earth is extremely unlikely until we get to the point that the sun enlarges and all the oceans boil away,” he said. “Many organisms, in particular animals and bacteria, live in the deep ocean, which the authors show would be unaffected by any conceivable cosmic cataclysm.”Mark Blaxter, professor of evolutionary genomics at the University of Edinburgh, agreed, adding that there are other organisms have a similar survival strategy to tardigrades. What’s more, he said, there are also organisms that live very deep underground in hot water within continental and under-sea-floor rocks. “Sterilising the planet would have to deal with these too,” he noted. He also stressed that even tardigrades are not invincible. “[Land-based] tardigrades stay alive in extreme conditions by drying out completely. So if there was no water left … there would be no “live” tardigrades, just dried up ones,” said Blaxter. “And if there was some water left so that the tardigrades could re-animate, if there was no food left they eat algae and fungi - they too would be dead in a couple of weeks.”Cobb, too, noted that even if the tardigrades were the only survivors, they would face a struggle. “For the tardigrades to inherit the Earth, whatever catastrophe swept over the planet would have to return to normal-ish conditions within a matter of decades at most, or it really could be curtains,” he said."

 Of all the rules at Wimbledon – and there are many – surely none is more outdated than one referring to players’ clothing. Not the part that insists they should wear “almost entirely white” attire, something players do not mind. But rather the one that refers to the colour of their underwear and how visible it is during play. First Venus Williams was asked to change her pink bra in a first-round match, which drew a suitably clipped response to a media inquiry: “I don’t like talking about bras in press conferences. It’s weird.” On Wednesday, four junior doubles players were asked to change their underwear because it could be seen under their white shorts, and on Thursday the 18‑year‑old Austrian Jurij Rodionov was asked by a supervisor to show her his underwear. “Yesterday I wore black pants and nobody said anything and today I wore blue and suddenly it’s a problem,” he said. “It was a big surprise for me.” Rodionov said Wimbledon provided him with two white pairs. “One was a little bit too big but these ones were OK,” he said. Asked if the rule was outdated, he said: “Wimbledon is always special. Maybe it’s a little bit too much but I like that the players only have to wear white. It’s tradition.”On the eve of the championships, Andre Agassi said he did not want to consult Novak Djokovic’s former coach Boris Becker to get an idea of what to expect as he began his new role working with the Serb, because he was trying to avoid going in with any preconceptions. That is definitely not the case for Jonas Bjorkman, who has been coaching Marin Cilic since August of last year. The Swede was spotted chatting to Cilic’s former long‑term coach Bob Brett after the Croat’s victory against Gilles Muller, possibly about how to get the better of Sam Querrey in the semi-finals.Magdalena Rybarikova captured the imagination of the Wimbledon crowds with her run to the semi‑finals, the first time she had been beyond the third round of any of the grand slam tournament. It was big news in Slovakia but she is not going to have any trouble walking around without being noticed, it seems. While doing a TV interview the day before her defeat by Garbiñe Muguruza, several people walked past without even spotting her. At the same time the nine-times champion Martina Navratilova, wearing a hat, was chased down the street outside Wimbledon by two people who had not fallen for the (slim) disguise."

Six Afghan teenage girls are to compete in person in a global robotics competition in Washington on Sunday after the US reversed a decision not to grant them visas.The initial rejection of the team’s visa sparked international outcry and the girls became national celebrities in Afghanistan, where many are perplexed about the repercussions of new US immigration rules and feel abandoned by their American allies.A US state department official confirmed to the Guardian that there were new developments under way in the girls’ case. The team said they had been asked to go to the embassy in Kabul on Thursday. “We are so happy I can’t find words for it,” Rodaba Noori, 15, said from the runway as the girls were about to board a plane from their home city, Herat, to the Afghan capital.“We will stay in the United States for about seven days. We will compare the cultures between the US and Afghanistan, and go sightseeing and talk to the people,” she said, in English. In an interview before the reversal, the girls had expressed their shock at the rejection. “We thought the US and Afghanistan had friendly relations. We thought the US’s fight for women’s rights and equality would get us visas,” Noori said.Yet since it took international outrage to sway the US visa decision, the U-turn will not assuage confusion in Afghanistan over Washington’s future commitments. Human Rights Watch called the visa denial “all too emblematic of the hollowness of US efforts to empower girls in Afghanistan”.Successive American governments have heralded women’s rights as a key reason for US forces’ continued stay in Afghanistan, and a cornerstone of US aid to the country is the five-year Promote programme, which states: “Everyone who cares about the future of Afghanistan supports women’s empowerment as the foundation for economic growth, peace and security.”Only teams from Afghanistan and the Gambia were denied visas for the competition, neither of which is among the six Muslim-majority countries subjected to Donald Trump’s travel ban.Afghans often struggle to get US visas. In May, only 112 Afghan applicants received the B1/B2 visa to the US that the girls applied for. In the same period the US granted the same visa to 1,091 applicants from Iran and 274 from Sudan, which are now subject to Trump’s travel ban after the US supreme court partially reinstated it.When told that a team from Iran had received visas, the girls could not contain their laughter. “Why is it only Afghans who can’t go? It’s discrimination. It really makes me angry,” said Lida Azizi, 16.The US embassy in Kabul did not disclose why it rejected the robotics competition team. However, given the process, the most likely cause was a suspicion that the girls intended to migrate.Asked whether they would return to Afghanistan after their US trip, the girls – aged 14 to 16 – seemed baffled. “Of course we will. We have our studies, our families, our classmates, our entire lives here,” said Azizi. “We don’t have any relatives in the US. We only want to go for the competition.”If they make it on time, the girls will watch their ball-sorting robot compete against teams from 156 other countries in the First Global Challenge.From the beginning, the Afghan girls were at a disadvantage. In the male-dominated field of technology, the team’s sponsor wanted an all-female team to represent Afghanistan. But only six of the top 15 girls who emerged got permission from their families to compete.The next hurdle was Afghan customs which, apparently confused by the package sent by the organisers, held the equipment for three and a half months, leaving the girls with only two weeks to build the robot. “The organisers said, ‘you can’t do this’,” said Alireza Mehraban, the team’s mentor. To finish on time, the girls worked over the fasting month of Ramadan. “We were tired but we came here, even during Eid,” said Kawsar Roshan. She said the team wanted to show the world how far Afghan girls had come during a western intervention that began before most of them were born.“Since I was a child, I wanted to show that girls can do anything, also outside the home,” Kawsar said.To apply for visas, the team twice travelled to Kabul, despite a recent spike in violence in the capital.Two days before their second embassy appointment, a truck bomb killed 150 people in Kabul’s diplomatic quarter. The day they arrived, anti-government protests had the city in lockdown. The girls had to walk to the US embassy, where they received their rejection.“They cried for six hours,” said Mehraban, the mentor. Fatemah Qaderyan said she cried so much she couldn’t leave her relatives’ house in Kabul and missed her return flight.For Roya Mahboob, the chief executive of the Digital Citizen Fund, which sponsors the team, allowing the girls to compete sends an important signal. “The feeling to not be ignored or be equal as boys if the opportunity is available to you is important,” she said."

497,"""A Canadian lobster fisherman died after getting struck by a North Atlantic right whale, moments after rescuing it on Monday. Joe Howlett had saved roughly two dozen whales in fifteen years, after they became tangled in fishing nets. The fisheries department said, """"taking part in whale rescue operations requires immense bravery and a passion for the welfare of marine mammals.""""""","Joe Howlett helped to rescue a north Atlantic right whale that had become heavily tangled in rope and was struck by the mammal afterwardA Canadian lobster fisherman who saved dozens of endangered whales after they became tangled in fishing nets has been killed – moments after a last successful rescue.Joe Howlett, from Campobello Island, New Brunswick, boarded a vessel off the province’s eastern coast on Monday to help rescue a north Atlantic right whale that had become heavily tangled in rope. The rescue was steeped in urgency: in the past month, seven north Atlantic right whales have been found floating lifelessly in the Gulf of St Lawrence, off Canada. With a global population believed to be around 525, the string of deaths suggests that more than 1% of the population has died in recent weeks. Howlett helped free the whale – only to be struck by the mammal moments later, said Mackie Green of the Campobello Whale Rescue Team. “They got the whale totally disentangled and then some kind of freak thing happened and the whale made a big flip,” Green, who was not onboard the vessel, told the Canadian Press.Howlett had previously saved some two dozen whales over the past 15 years, making use of his deep knowledge of knots and ropes to set the huge mammals free. Just a few days before his death, Howlett had helped liberate another north Atlantic right whale in the region, cutting away a fishing line caught in its mouth. “Joe definitely would not want us to stop because of this,” said Green, who joined forces with Howlett to launch the whale rescue in 2002. “This is something he loved and there’s no better feeling than getting a whale untangled, and I know how good he was feeling after cutting that whale clear.”On Tuesday, the federal fisheries department confirmed that Howlett had been killed while on one of its vessels, describing him as an “irreplaceable member of the whale rescue community”.In a statement, the department offered its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the father of two. “Taking part in whale rescue operations requires immense bravery and a passion for the welfare of marine mammals,” it noted. “There are serious risks involved with any disentanglement attempt. Each situation is unique, and entangled whales can be unpredictable.”Howlett’s death comes amid the unprecedented loss of seven north Atlantic right whales in the past month. A team included marine biologists, federal scientists and pathologists, among others, have been racing to figure out why the whales – which live along the eastern seaboard of Canada and the US and can reach up to 16 metres (50ft) in length – are dying in large numbers. Last week, they carried out necropsies on three of the seven whales, hoping to find clues before the carcasses decompose. While their findings are still preliminary and don’t explain why the deaths have seemingly occurred within such a short time frame, they found signs of severe blunt trauma and bruising on two of the whales, suggesting collision with a vessel, while the third had been tangled in fishing gear for weeks."

Worried your body odour is out of control but suspect your colleagues are too polite to say anything about it? Now there’s an app for that, too.A Japanese tech company has begun selling a device that allows people to self-test their sweaty exteriors for three categories of smell.The pocket-sized detector, which looks like a tape recorder, connects by Bluetooth to a smartphone app that divulges the potentially ominous results in a suitably discreet manner.Konica Minolta, the firm previously best known for producing cameras and printers, believes there is a market for the odour checker in Japan because people are “particularly sensitive to smell”.There is even a word in Japanese for the behaviour of office workers who annoy others with their noxious aromas – sumehara, or “smell harassment”.At a launch event in Tokyo on Thursday, this reporter discovered the inevitable consequences of walking 30 minutes in the searing summer sun to get to the venue.A check behind the ear revealed fairly high readings of sweat smells and middle-fat odours. “Immediately care is needed,” the app warned in a message on the results page.There was, however, nothing detected in the category kareishū – which translates as old-age smell, commonly associated with the substance 2-nonenal.Daisuke Koda, who is the incubation lead at Konica Minolta Japan’s business innovation centre, said the idea arose after a discussion he had with several male colleagues, all aged about 40, two years ago.They were discussing the increasingly intense summer heat and confided in each other that they sometimes were afraid of how they smelled.“We looked for a device to measure body smell, only to find that there was no device at all to tell the different types of smells,” Koda told the Guardian.“That prompted us to think it might be an opportunity for a new business and we continued our research further deeper.”Studies showed that the number one etiquette concern in the workplace was body smell, Koda added. At the same time, people found it difficult to speak out about another colleague’s odours.“We see challenges that these people are aware of but nobody has a solution for,” he said.The resulting device is called Kunkun Body, which takes its name from the Japanese word for sniff. It can be used to test for smells in four locations: near the head, behind the ear, under the armpit and around the feet.The device is available to Japanese buyers as part of a set of care products in a crowdfunding drive launched on Thursday morning. Early adopters are offered discounts on the recommended retail price of 30,000 yen (US$265 or £206) with the devices set to be delivered later this year.The company said it had no current plans to sell the device outside Japan.It’s not the first device aimed at addressing smell-related worries in Japan. Last year, Sony released a portable aroma diffuser called Aromastic. Owners of the device, dubbed an “aromatic Walkman”, can select which scent they want to be emitted in their vicinity.In a bid to beat the notoriously hot and humid summer conditions, people in Japan often carry around handkerchiefs to wipe away sweat and parasols to block the sun’s rays.In June last year, retailers and manufacturers reported an increase in sales of antiperspirants and wipe products compared to the previous year, according to a report by Jiji Press."

Djokovic is the 10th player to retire. “We’ve had a very long, very tough year with a lot of matches. Bodies have taken a lot physically. As an athlete, one way or another you are going to experience this kind of thing. Injuries are part of sport.”

1.31pm EDT
13:31

Djokovic continues. “The intensity and level of pain was increasing as the days went by. I was feeling it since the beginning of the tournament. I kept doing everything with my physiotherapist. It was only getting worse. Today was the worst day. Probably the fact I played yesterday, days adding up, it wasn’t helping. I’m not a specialist but I’m going to speak with some and understand what needs to be done. I haven’t considered not starting. I always like to give it a shot and step on the court. That’s all I could do.”

1.29pm EDT
13:29

Djokovic says he will talk with specialists to see how he can solve the problem. He says he needs to rest.

1.28pm EDT
13:28

Was it challenging to play back-to-back days? “Those kind of circumstances don’t really help. At the end of the day it’s the kind of situation you have to accept. I spent two hours on the table. It wasn’t to be. For an athlete there is no way out if you don’t feel fit.” 

1.27pm EDT
13:27

Novak Djokovic speaks. “It’s not the shoulder, it’s the elbow that keeps bothering me. For over a year and a half actually. It’s unfortunate I have to finish Wimbledon in this way. I was able for 30 minutes to play with some pain that was bearable. All the treatments and medication couldn’t help. The serves and forehands were where I could feel it the most and after that there was really no point.”

After a medical timeout, Novak Djokovic is ready for the second set on Court 1. He’d won 14 sets in a row against Tomas Berdych. Not a 15th, though. I wonder if he’ll suffer the kind of collapse we saw against Dominic Thiem in Paris?

Looking to force a first-set tie-break, Tomas Berdych, races into a 40-0 lead. You feel he’s playing at his maximum, whereas Novak Djokovic can still go up a level or two. So it proves when Djokovic charges to deuce. Eventually Berdych holds.

12.37pm EDT

After taking a rather lengthy toilet break after the second set, Milos Raonic is feeling more peppy and he earns his first break point in the second game of the third set. The unflappable Federer saves it with accurate serving and holds with an ace.

There’s no sign of a break on Court 1. It’s still on serve after seven games and Djokovic leads 4-3.

12.27pm EDT
12:27

“Any ideas on what’s happened to Milos’ forehand?” says Michael Devine. “It’s a completely different stroke in this match—high, looping topspins that sit up invitingly and land short, as opposed to his usual flat stroke. If this is Mark Knowles’ work, I’d say his tenure is going to be short.”Raonic has had a few injury problems this year, so perhaps he’s not at full pelt. Still, he’s dropping his forehands very short today and that’s asking for it against Federer, who’s giving it the treatment.

12.25pm EDT

Federer earns three set points with an ace. This is preposterous. He pings a forehand into the left corner and Raonic nets a backhand. The Canadian’s surely not winning this one.

The sun breaks out from behind the clouds as Federer moves into a 30-0 lead, Raonic unable to do anything with a couple of returns. He swings a serve down the T to earn two set points.

“Any ideas on what’s happened to Milos’ forehand?” says Michael Devine. “It’s a completely different stroke in this match—high, looping topspins that sit up invitingly and land short, as opposed to his usual flat stroke. If this is Mark Knowles’ work, I’d say his tenure is going to be short.”Raonic has had a few injury problems this year, so perhaps he’s not at full pelt. Still, he’s dropping his forehands very short today and that’s asking for it against Federer, who’s giving it the treatment.

Para athlete Abdullah Hayayei has died after being “struck by a metal pole” during a training incident on Tuesday in London before the upcoming World Para Athletics Championships. The 36-year-old, who represented the United Arab Emirates in the F34 class javelin and shot put at Rio 2016, was training at Newham Leisure Centre in preparation for the championships, which begin on Friday at the London Stadium.The Metropolitan Police said: “Police, London Ambulance Service and London’s Air Ambulance were called shortly after 17:00hrs on Tuesday, 11 July, to reports of a seriously injured man at Newham Leisure Centre in Prince Regent Lane, E13. The man was pronounced dead at the scene at 17:20hrs. “At this early stage, it is believed the man was struck by a metal pole which formed part of training facilities at the centre. It can be confirmed that the man was a competitor at the World Para Athletic Championships. His next of kin have been informed. The Health and Safety Executive have been informed.” The incident was witnessed by some of his team-mates as well as coaches and athletes from other competing nations, all of whom have been offered counselling. Majid Al Usaimi, the vice president of the UAE Disabled Sports Federation, told Dubai Sports TV that the pole formed part of the discus cage at the venue. He said: “We are overcome by grief, all of the UAE delegation here in London, and are truly shocked by this news, but it is God’s will. We cannot discuss the details of the incident but what I can say is that during afternoon practice at the official training venue of the competition, Abdullah was going through his usual training routines, before the metal discus cage fell on his head. The on-site medical staff tried to help him but to no avail.”London 2017 would have been Hayayei’s second World Championships and he was due to compete in the shot put, discus and javelin F34 events. At the 2015 championships in Doha, Qatar, Hayayei came fifth in the discus and finished eighth in shot put. An International Paralympic Committee (IPC) statement said: “The athlete’s family who are in the UAE have been informed of his death and the UAE team were brought together at the team hotel to be informed of the tragic news.” A moment of silence will be held to remember Hayayei during Friday’s opening ceremony, while further tributes are being planned. Ed Warner, co-chair of London 2017, added: “This is a devastating event and everyone within the London 2017 organising committee is shocked and saddened. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of Abdullah’s family and team-mates at what is undoubtedly a very difficult time for them. We will be working closely with all the competitors and teams over the days ahead to offer support wherever it is needed.”Newham Leisure Centre, one of two official training venues for the championships, remains closed while a police investigation takes place.

"," Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe Cricket Advisory Committee comprising of Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulakr and VVS Laxman picked Ravi Shastri as Team India's new head coach on Tuesday after consulting with Team India captain Virat Kohli.Meanwhile, Zaheer Khan has been named bowling coach while Rahul Dravid will be batting coach for overseas tours.WATCH FULL VIDEOThe CAC met on Monday to interview five candidates for the coach's job. Shastri along with Virender Sehwag, Richard Pybus, Tom Moody and Lalchand Rajput were the one's running for the coach's job. However, Ganguly announced in a press conference that followed the interviews that they will only announce the coach after consulting with captain Kohli, who is in the USA. He also said that they're not in a hurry to name someone.However, looks like things were done quickly and Shastri is all set to lead Team India along with Kohli in the upcoming Sri Lanka tour later this month.The 55-year old, who had earlier chose not to apply for the coach's job once Anil Kumble stepped down, changed his mind after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) extended the deadline for the applications to July 9. If reports are to be believed, it was also said that CAC member Sachin Tendulkar had urged him to apply for the post because of his close relationship with the current crop of Indian players.TEAM DIRECTOR (2014-16)Shastri had taken over as Team India's team director back in 2014 after India lost the Test series against England 1-3 while Duncun Fletcher was the coach of the national team. He left his post after the World T20 in India back in 2016, where the home side lost to West Indies in the semis. ('Elder brother' Ravi Shastri faces overseas test as India coach stint begins)Back then, he said that his job was to oversee things and everyone in the team would report to him.Under him, the Indian team won the five-match ODI series in England 3-1.Then the West Indies toured India for five ODIs, a T20I and three Tests. But the Windies went back home due to pay disputes just after the ODI series, which they lost 2-1. India then won the whitewashed Sri Lanka 5-0.India toured Australia towards the fag end of 2014 for a Test series and a triangular ODI series against England and Australia. It is under him that Virat Kohli took over as the full-time Test captain. Kohli led the side in the first Test at Adelaide in Mahendra Singh Dhoni's absence and lost the match by 48 runs. Dhoni then returned for the next two Tests but decided to sit out the last match due to an injury and step down as the Test captain, handing Kohli the full-time captaincy at Sydney -- the match ended as a draw. India lost four-match Test series Australia 2-0 and did not qualify for the finals of the tri-series.But he guided the team to the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2015 Down Under Under, where they lost to eventual champions Australia by 95 runs.NO.1 TEST RANKINGThe lowest point during his term has to be losing the three-match limited-overs series against Bangladesh in 2-1 right before the Sri Lanka series in 2015.But the team bounced back when they toured Sri Lanka for a three-match Test series. This was Kohli's first full-time assignment as the captain. India lost the first match by 63 runs. However, Kohli's men came back strong and won the next two matches to clinch the series 2-1.India lost the following three-match T20 series to the touring South Africans 2-0 and the five-match ODI series 3-2. But they whitewashed the Proteas 3-0. India also became No. 1 Test side and stayed there for eight weeks until Australia took over in February 2016.India then went to Australia for a five-match ODI series only to lose it 4-1 but managed a 3-0 whitewash in the following T20I series in early 2016. This was also India's first limited-overs bilateral series victory in Australia. Following that, India defeated the Lankans 2-1 in a three-match T20 series and also won the Asia Cup for the sixth time. That was followed by the World T20 in India, where they lost in the semis and that was the end of Shastri at the helm of the Indian team.Most of the Indian cricketers have been a fan of Shastri's man-management skills and he has always heaped praise on the senior cricketers and earned the respect of the players for his friendly ways. He was also touted to be the next coach when the CAC met but they decided to go with Anil Kumble and the leg-spinner did a formidable job before falling out with captain Kohli and resigning after the ICC Champions Trophy last month.After the whole Kohli-Kumble fiasco, the BCCI has directed the CAC to pick a person, who can be friendly with the team and the captain. Shastri becomes an instant favourite to land the job and accompany Kohli and Co. to Sri Lanka for his first assignment as the full-time coach of the Indian cricket team.

China will completely block access to much of the global internet as part of a sweeping crackdown aimed at suppressing dissent and maintaining the Communist party’s grip on power.The government has ordered China’s three telecommunications companies to completely block access to virtual private networks, or VPNs, by February 2018, Bloomberg News reported, citing anonymous sources. The three internet providers, China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, are all state-owned.China operates the largest internet censorship regime in the world, blocking access to thousands of websites including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Internet controls also mean news and commentary critical of the ruling Communist party and information about events like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre are almost impossible to find within China.But millions of Chinese citizens circumvent China’s censorship system, known as the Great Firewall, by using a VPN, allowing unfettered access to any website. The latest directive comes as China prepares for a twice a decade political meeting in Beijing in late 2017, with various factions within the government jockeying for dominance in any potential shuffle of top officials. It also comes on the heels of a 14-month “cleanup” of internet services announced in January, part of president Xi Jinping’s push for so-called “internet sovereignty”. “This is a significantly escalated form of internet control and shows there is unprecedented urgency and desperation at the top of the government,” said Xiao Qiang, a professor focusing on censorship in China at the University of California, Berkeley. “This is clearly about the highest levels of political struggle and the different factions using the internet as their battlefield.“If Xi’s opponents cannot release information inside China because of the censorship apparatus, they do it outside China and then the information filters back.”Xiao pointed to recent cracks in the Great Firewall, including allegations of corruption levelled by a Chinese businessman in New York that have managed to circulate widely within China. The claims, many unverified, have been seen as damaging to the head of the country’s corruption watchdog and one of Xi’s closest allies. In the coming months Xiao predicted the authorities would step up their internet crackdown: “There have always been controls, but this will be another level”.The ban on VPNs could also harm academics, software developers and foreign businesses. For years Chinese researchers have complained they lack adequate access to overseas journals and methods to communicate with universities around the world, while developers rely on code hosted on websites based outside China. Foreign businesses in China often use VPNs to secure their company data or communicate with company headquarters. It is not clear whether the ban will affect corporate VPNs.“This is ridiculous. If they’re as interested in security and stability as they say they are, then they should leave VPNs accessible,” Kaiser Kuo, former head of international communications at Chinese tech giant Baidu, posted online. “The number of people using them in China is really small, but really vocal — and I don’t think they’ll just take this lying down. Will reflect very badly on the party. Dark days ahead.”Earlier this month a popular Chinese VPN was forced to shut down after “receiving a notice from regulatory departments”.China has instituted bans on VPNs and other methods to bypass censorship in the past, especially during high-level government meetings in Beijing. But it remains to be seen whether the latest directive will become permanent. "

Donald Trump Jr has been forced to release damning emails that reveal he eagerly embraced what he was told was a Russian government attempt to damage Hillary Clinton’s election campaign.The stunning disclosure raised questions over whether campaign laws were broken and why senior Trump associates failed to report a hostile act by a foreign power.Trump Jr also admitted on Tuesday night that he could have handled the situation better but he had not told his father about meeting a Russian lawyer because “it was a nothing”.The emails show music promoter Rob Goldstone telling the future US president’s son that “the crown prosecutor of Russia” had offered “to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father”.British-born Goldstone adds in the exchange of 3 June 2016: “This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr Trump.”Seventeen minutes later, Trump Jr welcomes this with the reply: “If it’s what you say, I love it, especially later in the summer.”In a later email, Goldstone describes the Russian lawyer they are due to meet, Natalia Veselnitskaya, as a “Russian government attorney”.Natalia Veselnitskaya is the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort at Trump Tower on 9 June 2016. Trump Jr has published emails showing Veselnitskaya was introduced to him as a “Russian government attorney” who had damaging information about Hillary Clinton.Veselnitskaya is a defence lawyer based just outside Moscow, whose main client in recent years has been Denis Katsyv, a businessman accused of profiting from a major tax fraud uncovered by lawyer Sergei Magnitsky. She fought his case in US courts and mounted a PR campaign to try to clear Katsyv’s name and overturn the “Magnitsky Act” sanctions against Russian officials that followed.Veselnitskaya is not a government official and portrays herself as a lawyer with a private client. The question, then, is how she was able to secure the meeting at Trump Tower during a presidential campaign and why she was introduced to Trump Jr as representing the Russian government.Trump Jr agrees, adding that he would probably be accompanied by “Paul Manafort (campaign boss)” and “my brother-in-law,” Jared Kushner, husband of Trump’s daughter Ivanka and now a senior White House adviser.The formatting of the emails suggests that Trump Jr forwarded the whole chain to Manafort and Kushner before the meeting the three attended with Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York on 9 June.On Sunday, Trump Jr had said he had asked Manafort and Kushner to attend but not told them what the meeting was about. An associate of Manafort said on Tuesday that the former campaign chairman claims not to have read to the bottom of the chain of emails forwarded to him and Kushner by Trump Jr about the meeting. Jamie Gorelick, an attorney for Jared Kushner, did not respond to questions about whether Kushner read the emails and why he attended the meeting.Critics seized on the new disclosures to question why three of Trump’s closest advisers were willing to accept such a meeting instead of alerting authorities to interference by a foreign adversary. Special counsel Robert Mueller and the House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating Russian meddling in the election, thought to include stealing Democratic National Committee emails and the use of social-media bots to spread fake news about Clinton.My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency.Trump Jr has offered shifting explanations for the meeting in recent days. In an interview broadcast on conservative Fox News on Tuesday night, he again sought to justify his motives but conceded that he could have handled the situation better.“In retrospect I probably would have done things a little differently,” he told interviewer Sean Hannity. “Again this is before the Russia mania, this is before they were building this up in the press.Trump Jr denied that he told his father about the meeting. “It was just a nothing,” he added. “There was nothing to tell. I mean, I wouldn’t have even remembered it until you started scouring through this stuff. It was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame.”Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders read a short statement from the president at the regular White House press briefing. “My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency.”She then refused to answer several questions on the matter, saying they must be directed to Trump Jr’s legal counsel and outside counsel.Asked about the president’s reaction to the unfolding drama, Huckabee Sanders replied: “I think the president is, I would say, frustrated with the process, the fact this continues to be an issue and he would love for us to be focused on issues like the economy, healthcare, tax reform, infrastructure.”Clinton’s running mate Tim Kaine, a senator from Virginia and member of the foreign relations committee, told MSNBC: “These emails are explosive. This should have set off alarm bells and red lights, and yet what it seemed to do is activate their salivatory glands. This is just wheelbarrows of new evidence for the special counsel and the Senate intelligence committee.”Trump Jr released the email chain on Tuesday apparently to pre-empt its publication by the New York Times, which, this weekend, first broke the news of his meeting with Veselnitskaya in June last year. Veselnitskaya had promised compromising information about Clinton but apparently failed to deliver.In a statement posted to Twitter, Trump Jr explained: “To everyone, in order to be totally transparent, I am releasing the entire email chain of my emails with Rob Goldstone about the meeting on June 9, 2016. To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue.”There is no such position as crown prosecutor of Russia, but the most likely candidate would be the long-serving prosecutor general, and a long-standing member of Vladimir Putin’s elite, Yuri Chaika.Goldstone told the Wall Street Journal his reference to the “crown prosecutor” was meant to mean Veselnitskaya. “It’s a language thing,” he said. He referred questions from the Guardian to his lawyer.Trump Jr has given varying reasons for why he accepted the meeting, first claiming it was to discuss American adoptions of Russian children, then acknowledging that he was interested in information about Clinton.The president’s eldest son denies any wrongdoing and tweeted on Tuesday: “Media and Dems are extremely invested in the Russia story. If this nonsense meeting is all they have after a year, I understand the desperation!”Goldstone told the Associated Press on Monday he set up the meeting on behalf of a client, pop star Emin Agalarov, the son of a Moscow-based developer, Aras Agalarov, who has close ties to Putin and tried to partner with Trump in a hotel project.Aras Agalarov worked with Donald Trump to bring the Miss Universe contest to Moscow in 2013. Trump appeared in a music video with Emin Agalarov that featured several Miss Universe contestants.Goldstone’s 3 June email says the Russian government’s support for Trump is “helped along by Aras and Emin”. He asks if Trump Jr wants to speak to Emin about it directly and proposes: “I can also send this info to your father via Rhona” – presumably Rhona Graff, Donald Trump’s longtime executive assistant – “but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.” It is not clear from the emails whether Goldstone did send any of the information to Trump Sr, who has denied all knowledge of the meeting through his lawyer. Before the publication of Trump Jr’s emails, Veselnitskaya had denied she had gone to the meeting with information about the Clinton campaign. “It’s quite possible that maybe they were looking for such information, they wanted it so badly,” she told NBC, denying that she had any to offer. She also answered “no” when asked if she had ever worked for the Russian government.Later, Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US, dismissed the significance of the Trump Jr meeting. “I don’t think anything about it and to be honest there are more serious things to be think about in relation to Russia,” he told the Guardian at a US-Russia Business Council farewell reception in Washington.Trump Jr was at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday, according to a police officer at the building.Eric Trump, Donald Jr’s brother, was spotted in the lobby at around 1.30pm with his wife Lara. Asked by the Guardian if he had any comment on his brother’s emails or knew Goldstone himself, Eric Trump did not respond. He then headed quickly to a gold elevator and headed upwards, staring silently ahead.The revelations around 39-year-old Trump Jr’s involvement is one of the biggest blows yet in the saga of the Trump campaign’s alleged ties to Russia, which the president has dismissed as a “hoax”.Republicans on Capitol Hill were taken aback but reluctant to weigh in just yet. At least two Republicans on the Senate intelligence committee, Senators John Cornyn and James Lankford, said Trump Jr should testify before the panel, which is overseeing one of three parallel investigations into Russian interference in the US election.John McCain, a frequent critic of the Trump administration, said there were “many allusions and many stories of meetings and communications”, while noting he expected there was more yet to come.Richard Burr, the Republican chief of the Senate intelligence committee, said it was “too early to draw any conclusions”.Burr’s Democratic counterpart, Mark Warner, said it was significant that the emails had been forwarded to Kushner and Manafort.“They’ve got a lot of explaining to do, because all these denials of any knowledge of Russian government involvement seems to be a gross contradiction here,” Warner told Roll Call.Some of Trump’s most ardent defenders nonetheless stood by the president. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who competed bitterly against Trump for the Republican nomination, blamed the media for fixating on Russia.“Russia is a significant adversary,” he told reporters. “Part of the irony of this media obsession with Russia is that the Obama administration began with Hillary Clinton bringing the big reset button with Russia.Norm Eisen, former ethics czar under President Barack Obama, said: “It’s another significant step forward in the investigation of Trump collusion with Russia because it represents an offer to collude and an acceptance of collusion to harm the campaign of Hillary Clinton and intrude upon our democracy.”He added: “I believe it’s potentially legally actionable but we need to let the investigation play out. I predict it will not be the last bombshell.”Additional reporting by Shaun Walker in Moscow and Oliver Laughland and Jon Swaine in New YorkHere's my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQHere is page 4 (which did not post due to space constraints). pic.twitter.com/z1Xi4nr2gq"

A growing number of women in Iran are refusing to wear a hijab while driving, sparking a nationwide debate about whether a car is a private space where they can dress more freely.Obligatory wearing of the hijab has been an integral policy of the Islamic republic since the 1979 revolution but it is one the establishment has had a great deal of difficulty enforcing. Many Iranian women are already pushing the boundaries, and observers in Tehran say women who drive with their headscarves resting on their shoulders are becoming a familiar sight.Clashes between women and Iran’s morality police particularly increase in the summer when temperatures rise. But even though the police regularly stop these drivers, fining them or even temporarily seizing their vehicle, such acts of resistance have continued, infuriating hardliners over a long-standing policy they have had a great deal of difficulty enforcing. Iran’s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, has argued that people’s private space should be respected and opposes a crackdown on women who don’t wear the hijab. He said explicitly that the police’s job is not to administer Islam. Speaking in 2015, Rouhani said: “The police can’t do something and say I’m doing this because God said so. That’s not a police [officer]’s business.”Many in Iran believe that private space includes the inside of a car, but judicial authorities and the police have opposed that interpretation. “The invisible part of the car, such as the trunk, is a private space, but this does not apply to the visible parts of the car,” Hadi Sadeghi, the deputy head of Iran’s judiciary chief, said last week. His comments have prompted widespread reaction online, with one user posting a satirical picture showing a couple embracing in a car boot. Another user tweeted: “The police have said that only the boot is a private space... poor those of us who have a hatchback car [without a boot]... we don’t have any private space.” Local media often refrain from directly criticising the mandatory hijab, but the debate over what constitutes a private space has allowed newspapers and even state news agencies to publish articles reflecting views from both sides. “Private or not private?” asked an article carried by the state Irna news agency on Monday. “This is a question that has created a legal and religious discussion about private space within cars.” Hossein Ahmadiniaz, a lawyer, told Irna that infringing on people’s private spaces was like infringing their citizen’s rights, arguing that it was up to parliamentarians to define the private space and not the police. “The law says that the space within a car is a private space,” he said. “The government’s citizen’s rights charter [launched by Rouhani] also considers a car to be a private space and it is incumbent upon enforcers to respect that.”Bahman Keshavarz, a leading lawyer, wrote an article in the reformist Shargh daily, arguing that wearing a so-called “bad hijab” (loose hijab) is not a crime under Iranian law. Saeid Montazeralmahdi, a spokesperson for the Iranian police, disagreed. “What is visible to the public eye is not private space and norms and the rules should be respected within cars.” He also warned car owners against using tinted glass to prevent onlookers from seeing into the car. The debate is not only among liberal Iranians. Abolfazl Najafi Tehrani, a cleric based in Tehran, tweeted: “People’s cars, like people’s houses, are their property and a private space and infringing upon this space will disturb people’s moral security and will harm women’s trust with the police.”Yahya Kamalpour, a member of the Iranian parliament, said: “The space within people’s cars is a private space and the police has no right to enter that space without a judicial order.”The debate comes amid a growing rift between the government and the hardline judiciary that acts independently of Rouhani’s government. Despite restrictions, women are increasingly active in Iranian society. It emerged on Sunday that Iran Air, the country’s national airline, has for the first time appointed a female CEO. Rouhani is also under pressure from his voter base to nominate a record number of female ministers in his cabinet reshuffle next month. In a sign of slowly changing attitudes, Ali Karimi, a veteran Iranian footballer, on Monday called on the authorities to allow female fans to attend stadiums alongside men. "

The communications regulator is hunting a radio pirate who has repeatedly hijacked the airwaves of a local station with a deliberately offensive song about masturbation.The Winker’s Song, a 1970s ditty by an artist going by the name Ivor Biggun, has been illegally forced on to the output of Mansfield 103.2 at least eight times in the last month.Ofcom said it was taking the incident “extremely seriously” and its engineers were working closely with the radio station to trace and identify the pirate.Listeners were last subjected to the song, which uses the word “wanker” 36 times, this weekend during a live family broadcast from Mansfield’s Party in the Market event.It is believed the rogue broadcaster could be using a small transmitter to play the adult theme on the same frequency, overriding the station’s scheduled programming. Tony Delahunty, managing director of Mansfield 103.2, said: “Some people have told me that their children have started humming the song in the car. “We have had calls from people who have found it hilarious, while some have raised their concerns, including our competitors, and a lot of people in the industry are aghast at how difficult it is to stop these people.”Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he added: “There’s is absolutely nothing we could do about it and we’re trying very hard to do something about it.“We are told by Ofcom who are investigating the matter, that you only need, and this is the frightening thing, a small transmitter and if you can get near where there is an outside broadcast or a signal and you can overpower that signal [and] you’re on the airwaves.”He claimed the incidents raised the potential for a more serious hijacking of a radio station. “This is a clown but it exposes a situation that is available for, who knows a terrorist, that type of person, some idiot who wants to put emergency messages on. It could become an awful lot worse. The big problem is you can’t catch them …“I want it to stop, because it could be inflicting a very nasty message to very young kids and their parents could be annoyed.”Ofcom said maliciously causing radio interference was a criminal offence carrying a potential sentence of two years in prison and an unlimited fine.But a spokesman said “it doesn’t happen that often” and requires specialist knowledge and equipment. “You need quite a high-powered transmitter to be able to go over the levels that the station is broadcasting at to interrupt their frequencies.Ofcom stressed that it is not as easy to hack a radio station as Delahunty suggested He added: “We have a spectrum enforcement team who look after our airwaves and make sure they are kept free from interference, whether it is deliberate or accidental, and we have strong enforcement powers.If radio stations broadcast content that is deemed harmful or offensive, under the Digital Economy Act they can be suspended. Last week Ofcom suspended Sheffield based Imam FM after it broadcast lectures from a former terrorist leader."

Just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to a new report.The Carbon Majors Report (pdf) “pinpoints how a relatively small set of fossil fuel producers may hold the key to systemic change on carbon emissions,” says Pedro Faria, technical director at environmental non-profit CDP, which published the report in collaboration with the Climate Accountability Institute. Traditionally, large scale greenhouse gas emissions data is collected at a national level but this report focuses on fossil fuel producers. Compiled from a database of publicly available emissions figures, it is intended as the first in a series of publications to highlight the role companies and their investors could play in tackling climate change. The report found that more than half of global industrial emissions since 1988 – the year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established – can be traced to just 25 corporate and state-owned entities. The scale of historical emissions associated with these fossil fuel producers is large enough to have contributed significantly to climate change, according to the report. ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since 1988. If fossil fuels continue to be extracted at the same rate over the next 28 years as they were between 1988 and 2017, says the report, global average temperatures would be on course to rise by 4C by the end of the century. This is likely to have catastrophic consequences including substantial species extinction and global food scarcity risks.While companies have a huge role to play in driving climate change, says Faria, the barrier is the “absolute tension” between short-term profitability and the urgent need to reduce emissions.A Carbon Tracker study in 2015 found that fossil fuel companies risked wasting more than $2tn over the coming decade by pursuing coal, oil and gas projects that could be worthless in the face of international action on climate change and advances in renewables – in turn posing substantial threats to investor returns.CDP says its aims with the carbon majors project are both to improve transparency among fossil fuel producers and to help investors understand the emissions associated with their fossil fuel holdings. A fifth of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions are backed by public investment, according to the report. “That puts a significant responsibility on those investors to engage with carbon majors and urge them to disclose climate risk,” says Faria.Investors should move out of fossil fuels, says Michael Brune, executive director of US environmental organisation the Sierra Club. “Not only is it morally risky, it’s economically risky. The world is moving away from fossil fuels towards clean energy and is doing so at an accelerated pace. Those left holding investments in fossil fuel companies will find their investments becoming more and more risky over time.”There is a “growing wave of companies that are acting in the opposite manner to the companies in this report,” says Brune. Nearly 100 companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Ikea have committed to 100% renewable power under the RE100 initiative. Volvo recently announced that all its cars would be electric or hybrid from 2019. And oil and gas companies are also embarking on green investments. Shell set up a renewables arm in 2015 with a $1.7bn investment attached and a spokesperson for Chevron says it’s “committed to managing its [greenhouse gas] emissions” and is investing in two of the world’s largest carbon dioxide injection projects to capture and store carbon. A BP spokesperson says its “determined to be part of the solution” for climate change and is “investing in renewables and low-carbon innovation.” And ExxonMobil, which has faced heavy criticism for its environmental record, has been exploring carbon capture and storage.But for many the sums involved and pace of change are nowhere near enough. A research paper published last year by Paul Stevens, an academic at think tank Chatham House, said international oil companies were no longer fit for purpose and warned these multinationals that they faced a “nasty, brutish and short” end within the next 10 years if they did not completely change their business models. Investors now have a choice, according to Charlie Kronick, senior programme advisor at Greenpeace UK. “The future of the oil industry has already been written: the choice is will its decline be managed, returning capital to shareholders to be reinvested in the genuine industries of the future, or will they hold on, hoping not be the last one standing when the music stops?”"

Anyway, a race that lacked the drama and spills and thrills of Baku was nonetheless skilfully won from pole by Bottas, whose lightning start pretty much defined his race, once it was checked out by the stewards and declared legal. He held off another stern challenge from Vettel, who extended his championship lead over Hamilton to 20 points. But Bottas is now only 35 points behind, and you wouldn’t rule him out on current form. Hamilton climbed four places from pole, but couldn’t quite manage the explosive performance needed to get on the podium. Anyway, that’s all from me for now.

Lap 59: Hamilton sets a new fastest lap and is now only 2.9 secs behind Ricciardo in third. Kvyat pits for a second time – his third in total given his drive-through penalty – and he’s stone last.

9.10am EDT
09:10

Lap 58: Hamilton and Ricciardo both set their fastest lap times on the 57th, but they’re a distance behind the top two. Bottas still leads from Vettel.

9.08am EDT

Lap 56: Raikkonen struggles on a bend for grip, which gives Hamilton a bit of respite in his bid to hold onto a top four place. Vettel is now 2.9secs behind Bottas.Updated

Lap 55: This is another test of Bottas’s temperament – he’s shown he can handle pressure before, but it won’t be easy. As Vettel is told there may be rain before the end of the race, which Hamilton may like too but it’s probably too late.

9.06am EDT
09:06

Lap 54: Bottas’s lead is now 3.2seconds from Vettel – it’s closing all the time and this could be a tight finish, as Raikkonen in fifth sets the fastest lap of the race in 1: 07.6

9.05am EDT
09:05

Lap 53: Quick places recap: 1 Bottas 2 Vettel 3 Ricciardo 4 Hamilton 5 Raikkonen 6 Grosjean 7 Perez 8 Ocon 9 Massa 10 Stroll. A good lap from Hamilton puts him within three and a half seconds of Ricciardo, though Raikkonen is closing on Hamilton too.

9.03am EDT
09:03

Lap 52: Hamilton’s woes will be music to Vettel’s ears in terms of the title race but can he reel in Bottas? He’s closing slowly, and has 19 laps to cut that lead, which is currently around 3.8secs. Updated
at 9.03am EDT


9.02am EDT
09:02

Lap 51: Vettel cuts the gap to 3.8secs on Bottas, as Hamilton complains that “I’m struggling out here” – a pit stop would be risky, but Mercedes may need to do something; there’s blistering on his front left tyres too.

9.01am EDT
09:01

Lap 50: Vettel steps on the gas, reducing the gap to below four seconds – it’s now 3.9secs – and it puts more daylight between Vettel and Ricciardo in third. Hamilton is still ahead of Raikkonen; they’re in fourth and fifth respectively.

8.59am EDT
08:59

Lap 48: Massa pits, and can’t quite manage to emerge ahead of Ocon but has to make do with ninth place now. Bottas still leads.

8.58am EDT
08:58

Lap 47: Felipe Massa has had an excellent race, he’s up to sixth now, though he hasn’t pitted yet, but given where he started this is a fine performance. Bottas still leads by 4.45secs from Vettel. Updated

8.57am EDT

Lap 46: Sainz retires, sighing “what a glorious race”, as Bottas continues to lead and look comfortable again. Hamilton is back in fifth, and it still just doesn’t look to be happening for him today.Updated

8.55am EDT
08:55

Lap 45: So Bottas is back in front from Vettel, with Ricciardo third, Hamilton fourth and Raikkonen fifth. Vandoorne has been hit with a drive-through penalty for ignoring blue flags, which probably scuppers his chances of any points. Car problems for Red Bull’s Sainz – it looks as if he’s going to retire.

8.54am EDT
08:54

Lap 44: Bottas closes on Raikkonen, and takes him on into turn four, and passes him. He’s back in front and on those fresh tyres he made that look really easy. Raikkonen pits straight away.

8.53am EDT
08:53

Lap 43: Raikoinnen, yet to pit, is 1.25 secs ahead from Bottas, who is 2.8 secs ahead of Vettel, with Ricciardo fourth and Hamilton fifth. 

8.51am EDT
08:51

Lap 42: Bottas pits, and the changeover is a little ponderous, which hands Raikkonen the lead. Vettel is now a bit closer to Bottas in third place. So Raikkonen might tactically stay out even longer to help Vettel, as he’s told on the radio that Hamilton has “bad balance” and isn’t threatening yet.

8.49am EDT
08:49

Lap 40: Some Hamilton unhappiness with the condition of his right rear tyre, which looks a little blistered. He remains fifth, with Ricciardo in front of him in fourth. Raikkonen is still yet to pit in second place.Updated

8.47am EDT
08:47

Lap 38: Bottas appears to have been held up by the lapped Perez a little as he tried to take him on on the turn, but he retains his comfortable lead. On a similar theme, Vandoorne is under investigation over an incident with Raikkonen

Lap 35: Vettel pits, swiftly, moving onto super-softs – a smooth changeround, that. He drops to third behind Raikkonen in second, but the Finn is yet to pit. Bottas still leads, as he has the whole way. Hamilton is fifth. Further back, Vandoorne passes Eriksson to move into 14th. Palmer pits and switches to ultra-softsUpdated
at 8.44am EDT


8.42am EDT
08:42

Lap 34: Ricciardo also takes his pit stop, which drops him back to fourth for now, but he needed to do that with Hamilton closing

8.41am EDT
08:41

Lap 33: Raikkonen has just put in his best lap, and is told to stay out for the foreseeable – “do the opposite of Hamilton” being his race mantra. 

8.39am EDT
08:39

Lap 31: Bottas is eight seconds ahead now from Vettel, as Hamilton decides to come in first, taking 2.4secs, as he switches to the ultras. And he doesn’t lose any places, such is his lead over Grosjean in sixthUpdated
at 8.40am EDT


8.38am EDT
08:38

Lap 30: Magnussen has been called in, and this looks like the end of his race. Bottas still leads from Vettel.

8.37am EDT
08:37

Lap 29: Further back, Stroll and Massa have driven very well in 10th and ninth respectively, having come through well at the start. Car trouble for Magnussen, probably with the gear box – that “pop” sounded unhealthy.

8.36am EDT
08:36

Lap 28: Verstappen is talking about the accident that ended his race early on. “I’m very disappointed especially for the fans, who were the best crowd I’ve seen so far, and I couldn’t even complete a turn for them.” He looks glum, as well he might. If it weren’t for bad luck he’d have no luck at all.

8.34am EDT
08:34

Lap 27: Hamilton is agonisingly just short of being able to take on Raikkonen at the turns, and he’ll need to up his pace at some point. Bottas laps Wehrlein in 15th and continues to lead comfortably.

8.33am EDT
08:33

Lap 26: Hamilton moves a bit closer to Raikkonen again, looking to take advantage of the Ferrari driver’s tyre problems, but he’s still fifth in his super-softs."

We’re going to wrap up our live coverage of the G20 summit for the day. Thanks so much for joining me. Here’s a summary of what happened on the final day of the summit. 

11.39am EDT

French President Emmanuel Macron says that he has not given up on trying to get Donald Trump to chance his mind over the Paris climate deal. I never despair to convince, because I think it is a duty, given my position, and it is a trait of my character.

Speaking after a day of bilateral discussions at the G20 summit in Hamburg, the prime minister said the UK had led on bolstering the global fight against terror and modern slavery as well as pushing for the implementation of the Paris agreement and boosting international trade.On terrorism, Theresa May repeated past calls for world leaders to do more to disrupt international finance streams for terror groups and to help stop foreign fighters returning to the west from conflicts in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. She also said the G20 agreed to do more to combat domestic violent extremism and welcomed moves from technology companies to address the online spread of extremist content.The prime minister went on to describe modern slavery and trafficking as the “great human rights issue of our time” and highlighted the UK’s taskforce to combat the issue. She said more needed to be done around thew world and called for a “radically new global approach” to stopping human traffickers. On the Paris Agreement, the most contentious issue of the summit, May said she was “dismayed” at the US decision to leave the pact. She urged Trump to rejoin it and said, following questions, that she had pushed the US president to do so in conversations during the Hamburg meeting. May went on to say she was a leading advocate of free trade but admitted some had been “left behind” by globalisation - an admission she has made repeatedly in the past. She said the UK had pushed for G20 leaders to stop steel dumping practices and to do more to economically empower women. The prime minister added that the UK would work with others to improve international trading systems and to ensure more job opportunities for women. Linking her bilateral meetings to the Brexit process, May said she looked forward to agreeing trade deals with “new friends and old partners”. Asked about a visit from one of the UK’s oldest partners, the US, May said no date had been agreed for Trump’s arrival in London.

Theresa May is now holding a press conference. She said she is dismayed that the US have not changed their mind on withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, but Trump would still be visiting the UK although a date had not been set.May said: “Like other leaders, I am dismayed by the US withdrawing from the Paris agreement”She said had urged president Trump to change his mind and that the UK’s commitment “is as strong as ever”.“We play a leading role internationally,” she added. Discussions on Syria, violent extremism, modern slavery, women empowerment and trade had been positive, she said. On Brexit she said: “I’ve been struck by positivity of world leaders at G20 on Brexit trade.”Updated

Oliver MilmanWorld leaders have made clear the US’s isolated stance on climate change, with 19 of the G20 countries affirming their commitment to the “irreversible” Paris climate agreement.After lengthy negotiations that stretched well into Saturday, the final G20 joint statement notes Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris deal while stating that the world’s other major economies all still support the international effort to slow dangerous global warming.The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Saturday she “deplored” the US exit from the agreement and added she did not share the view of Theresa May, the British prime minister, that Washington could decide to rejoin the pact.Read the full article on the leader’s communique here:

Vladimir Putin said he had established a working relationship with US president Donald Trump, speaking at a press conference as the G20 summit draws to a close.The Russian president said thought there were grounds to believe at least partial cooperation with Washington could be achieved. Putin said he felt Trump had accepted Putin’s assertions that Moscow had not interfered in the US presidential election last year, but that it was best to ask Trump what his views on that were. He said the two leaders at their meeting had agreed to work together on cyber security and said he thought Trump in reality was a different person from the one seen on TV.Putin said Trump had asked him detailed questions regarding allegations that Moscow had interfered in last year’s US election. He said he had tried to give Trump detailed answers which he said seemed to satisfy his counterpart.The new ceasefire deal in southern Syria was the result of the United States altering its stance and becoming more pragmatic about the situation there, Putin said.He also said that certain pre-cursors had been created for an improvement in relations between Moscow and Washington going forward.

While climate change could not be agreed on, officials did reach a common statement including Trump about the other contentious issue at the summit, trade. However Merkel said discussions on subject with the US had been particularly difficult. The statement retains the G20’s longstanding rejection of protectionism. But it also acknowledged that trade must be mutually beneficial and that countries can use “legitimate” trade defenses to protect workers and industries against being taken advantage of by trade partners.Merkel reiterated her statement that Europeans have to take their fate “in their own hands,” saying that while cooperation with the US is important, some topics like trade, steel in particular, are “difficult” to discuss with the Americans.

In a press conference, Angela Merkel said world leaders have agreed their final communique at the G20 summit.She said 19 members of the Group of 20 have reaffirmed the Paris climate accord as “irreversible.”She made clear that it had been very difficult to get a consensus and in the end, breaking from tradition, a separate paragraph was included to cover the position of the US, who are withdrawing from the Paris climate change agreement and wanted fossil fuels to be mentioned. The German chancellor said the declaration makes absolutely clear that is not the common position of the other 19 world leaders. Merkel said there had been no compromise on climate change and called the US position “regrettable”.She said: “We amended the declaration and it says very clearly what the United States of America want and underneath what the other countries want.”The German chancellor said she “deplored” the decision by the US to withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, but said that all other nations agree Paris climate accord is irreversible.Here is the controversial section of the G20 communique:We take note of the decision of the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The United States of America announced it will immediately cease the implementation of its current nationally-determined contribution and affirms its strong commitment to an approach that lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs. The United States of America states it will endeavour to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently and help deploy renewable and other clean energy sources, given the importance of energy access and security in their nationally determined contributions. Directly following that paragraph is this one, as Merkel said in her press conference:The Leaders of the other G20 members state that the Paris Agreement is irreversible. We reiterate the importance of fulfilling the UNFCCC commitment by developed countries in providing means of implementation including financial resources to assist developing countries with respect to both mitigation and adaptation actions in line with Paris outcomes and note the OECD’s report “Investing in Climate, Investing in Growth”. We reaffirm our strong commitment to the Paris Agreement, moving swiftly towards its full implementation in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances and, to this end, we agree to the G20 Hamburg Climate and Energy Action Plan for Growth as set out in the Annex.

Trump has promised $639 million in funding for humanitarian programmes, including $331 million to help feed starving people in four famine-hit countries - Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria and Yemen. The US president’s pledge came during a working session of the G20 summit of world leaders in Hamburg, providing a “godsend” to the UN World Food Programme, the group’s executive director, David Beasley, told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting.“We’re facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War Two,” said Beasley, a Republican and former South Carolina governor who was nominated by Trump to head the world’s largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide. He said the additional funding was about a third of what the agency estimated was required this year to deal with urgent food needs in the four countries facing famine and in other areas. The WFP estimates that 109 million people around the world will need food assistance this year, up from 80 million last year, with 10 of the 13 worst affected zones stemming from wars and “man-made” crises, Beasley said. “We estimated that if we didn’t receive the funding we needed immediately that 400,000 to 600,000 children would be dying in the next four months,” he said. Trump’s announcement came after his administration proposed sharp cuts in funding for the US State Department and other humanitarian missions as part of his “America First” policy. Beasley said the agency had worked hard with the White House and the U.S. government to secure the funding, but Trump would insist that other countries contributed more as well. A WPF spokesman said Germany recently pledged an additional 200 million euros for food relief.The United States has long been the largest donor to the WFP."

Police from a region in the majority-Christian Philippines are considering issuing mandatory identification cards to thousands of Muslims living there – a proposal Human Rights Watch condemned as “collective punishment”.Authorities in Central Luzon, a region north of the capital, were quoted in local media as saying the policy was a counter-terrorism measure after Islamist militants took over a city hundreds of kilometres to the south on the island of Mindanao.The issue was discussed at a meeting between police, military and political figures and about 200 Muslim religious and community leaders at the provincial capitol building, according to news outlet Rappler.Chief Superintendent Aaron Aquino said the ID cards would allow authorities to identify and weed out undesirable individuals and terrorists, Rappler reported.He said the system had already been implemented in the town of Paniqui “and we want this to be replicated in all Muslim communities in the whole region for easy and efficient identification of our Muslim brothers and sisters”.Government forces have been hammering the city of Marawi in the south for nearly two months after local militant factions, who claim allegiance to Isis, rampaged through and took control.President Rodrigo Duterte has imposed martial law across Mindanao and had to apologise after blaming the residents of Marawi by saying they allowed Isis sympathisers to stay.Human Rights Watch said authorities were threatening to “single out Muslims” with ID cards, violating the rights to equal protection of the law and freedom of movement.“Requiring Muslim-only IDs in response to a perceived failure of Muslims to prevent Islamist fighters from entering Marawi City is a form of collective punishment,” the New York-based advocacy group said in a statement.It added that reports of some Muslim leaders present at the meeting not rejecting outright the compulsory ID cards were “irrelevant from a rights perspective” for the roughly 26,000 Muslims living in Central Luzon region. “ID requirements for Muslims should be rejected outright.”"

535,A Home Ministry official has revealed that the family of terror group Hizbul Mujahideen's slain commander Burhan Wani wanted him to surrender. Wani's relatives sought police intervention in 2013 after he left his home in 2010 and joined militancy at the age of 15. Wani was killed in an encounter with security forces on July 8 last year.," Jump to navigationSpeak NowLong before young Burhan Wani became the poster boy of Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), he fled from his home on 16 October 2010 and became a militant at the age of 15.He had reportedly decided to join the militancy due to an incident in which security personnel beat up his elder brother Khalid wani.It was in the summer of 2013, when Burhan Wani's relatives approached the then DG Ashok Prasad, appealing for the cops to intervene. Sources said that close relatives of Burhan Wani approached the top cop, asking for intervention.Burhan till then was not a top militant and not even in the top 10 most wanted terrorists. The family was asked to get in touch with SP Awantipora. The matter became inconsequential till Burhan rose to the ranks and eventually become its Commander.Ashok Prasad now advisor to MHA and an official spokesperson confirmed the incident with India Today. While Burhan's brother Khalid was eventually killed by security forces in April 2015 when he had gone along with three friends to meet his brother.WANI'S BROTHER A MILITANT SYMPATHISER The security forces claimed that Khalid was a militant sympathiser who had taken his friends to get them recruited and was killed in an encounter by the security forces.Burhan Wani  eventually became a poster boy of HM, featuring in several videos and photos posing with weapons and taunting security forces. These were circulated on Facebook and WhatsApp in an attempt to recruit young Kashmiri men.Reportedly his star power helped him to recruit nearly 100 Kashmiri youth.

The theme for this year’s International Women’s Day was “be bold for change” in the fight for a “more gender inclusive world” – but some at Tesla had a different plan for the day. It was an opportunity for women to discover essential oils. A “health and wellness group” at the electric car company invited female staff members to an 8 March “lunch ‘n learn” about oils and how they can help improve people’s “health and happiness”, according to emails seen by the Guardian, which reveal that the proposed event was quickly met with vocal criticism. It was particularly offensive to some given that a week earlier, AJ Vandermeyden, a female engineer, had publicly accused Elon Musk’s company of sexual harassment and discrimination.Tesla postponed the oils session. The company organized a town hall meeting on diversity for that day, which included six male executives and one woman, according to multiple attendees. At the crowded meeting at the Fremont factory, women took the microphone one-by-one and shared stories of sexual harassment, mistreatment by male managers, unfair promotion decisions and more, sources said.Vandermeyden, who attended the meeting, thought the outpouring of comments validated her own story. But soon after, Tesla fired her, accusing her of pursuing a “miscarriage of justice” by filing a lawsuit that alleged “pervasive harassment” and pay discrimination. Testimony from the town hall – along with internal emails from Musk, and Vandermeyden’s first interview since her termination – paint a picture of a company that has struggled to respond to mounting complaints about gender discrimination and has aggressively attempted to discredit a woman who publicly criticized it .“They just want to absolutely crush anyone who speaks up,” said Vandermeyden, 33, seated inside her attorney’s San Francisco office on a recent afternoon. “I spoke up, and I was made a sacrificial lamb for it. It’s a scary precedent.”Vandermeyden detailed the painful experience of losing a job she loved while facing harsh personal attacks by Tesla in the media. She has come forward at a time when the tech industry is grappling with high profile sexual misconduct scandals at Uber, a prominent venture capital firm and a popular startup incubator.Tesla, known internationally for its battery-powered vehicles and self-driving car technology, has strongly rejected Vandermeyden’s claims, saying she was terminated for “falsely attacking our company in the press”. But the flurry of criticisms that emerged at the town hall suggests that her complaints are not unique.Musk was not at the meeting, which was attended by roughly 70-100 people, and featured comments from more than 20 women, according to Vandermeyden and another attendee. One woman described parts of the factory as a “predator zone” for harassment. When the moderator asked women in the room if they had ever been catcalled, a significant number of women raised their hands, according to Vandermeyden.Other women allegedly talked about feeling unsafe around male managers and facing sexist remarks from superiors. Women talked about being dismissed and talked over in meetings with no other female employees, and asked questions about diversity in hiring and the lack of women in leadership positions.Some of the executives seemed genuinely concerned and taken aback by the women’s comments. One male leader said it was unacceptable, noting that he had daughters, said Vandermeyden.One female manager, who was present but no longer works for Tesla, told the Guardian she was offended by that comment: “It’s insulting. You shouldn’t have to have daughters to know this.” She said executives’ responses to questions about diversity were generic and filled with corporate jargon.Tesla said in an email that a Women in Tesla group hosted the event and that “executives attended because they wanted to hear directly from employees about their experiences and learn about how to improve the workplace”. The company disputed the Guardian’s characterization of the meeting, saying: “Employees stood up to ask the executives questions, share their experiences at Tesla – both positive and negative – while others spoke of things that they believed Tesla was doing right and some came with suggestions. In some instances, employees were only looking for better collaboration with their HR business partners in general and had nothing to do with any allegations of harassment.”The company statement said that when an employee referenced an area of the factory as a “predator zone”, it “surprised many in the room who had never heard of this term”. Immediately after the meeting, Tesla said it sent a factory-wide message to supervisors about its “strict policy against any kind of harassment”, adding, “Any complaints of catcalling in the factory are thoroughly investigated and action is taken where necessary.”Tesla also said that at the meeting, “there was a lot of energy around ensuring we are proactively sourcing diverse talent and ensuring that we have an interview and assessment process that is free from bias”.Vandermeyden said she talked briefly about her experience at the meeting, adding: “It was finally giving women a venue to voice what was going on. It felt like Tesla had been saying I’m making all this up. And here were all the women saying, ‘No, it’s happening.’ It’s too big to deny.”Her lawsuit, filed last year, alleged that after she was hired in 2013, she was promoted to a manufacturing engineering position in a department that consisted mostly of men and where she was paid less than male engineers whose work she directly assumed. Men were also granted positions over her, and she and other women were denied promotions despite their equal or superior qualifications, the complaint said. She also said that Tesla retaliated against her after she raised concerns about sexual harassment and catcalls she routinely faced on the factory floor. Vandermeyden went public with her story in an interview with the Guardian in February, prompting Tesla to vehemently deny her allegations, claiming that an internal investigation concluded that there was no harassment, discrimination or retaliation.On 23 May, Tesla announced the hiring of Gaby Toledano as the new chief people officer to oversee HR amid growing concerns about unsafe working conditions at the factory. Toledano joined as the only woman in the “c-suite”, meaning group of chief executives.One of her first major acts was to fire Vandermeyden. I’m the one who spoke up, and they’re saying, ‘One way or another, you have to leave.’ How is that right?Toledano asked Vandermeyden to meet for coffee one-on-one without lawyers on 29 May, the Memorial Day holiday. Vandermeyden said she thought it was an opportunity to discuss ways to improve the workplace and address her concerns, but instead she was told she could resign and get a severance package or she would be terminated immediately and should not show up for work the next day.“It felt like they were trying to intimidate me. I’m the one who spoke up, and they’re saying, ‘One way or another, you have to leave.’ How is that right?” Vandermeyden recalled in the recent interview. Toledano’s message to her was clear, she added: “‘You can end this now or this is going to be litigation going on for years.’”She refused to resign and was fired, she said. She has yet to return to Tesla to clean out her desk.Tesla disputed Vandermeyden’s account of the meeting, saying: “Gaby did not intimidate Ms Vandermeyden. She disagrees that there was any intimidation, nor did Ms Vandermeyden ever express feeling intimidated during the meeting. In fact, they both had a positive rapport and expressed mutual support, as Gaby was new to her role at Tesla and was attempting to resolve the matter in a positive and mutually supportive manner for the company and for Ms Vandermeyden.”Vandermeyden struggled to process the news and was further shocked when Tesla released a 430-word statement to the Guardian justifying the termination. “Vandermeyden was given special treatment and opportunities for advancement that were unwarranted based on her qualifications, and that negatively impacted other more qualified individuals,” the statement said, saying that she behaved in a “fundamentally false and misleading manner”. The company said she “falsely attacked” Tesla in the press, amounting to a “miscarriage of justice”, adding: “It is impossible to trust anyone after they have behaved in such a manner.”Her lawyer, Therese Lawless, well known for fighting discrimination in Silicon Valley, said the statement was clear evidence that Tesla’s termination was retaliation for raising concerns about workplace conditions, which is her legally protected right.In addition to saying she was not qualified for her job, Tesla has also repeatedly noted that Vandermeyden did not have an engineering degree, a fact many tech journalists have repeated in articles. But according to Vandermeyden and another Tesla employee, this is not uncommon; she said she knew of at least two male engineers in her department without a degree.  Musk also appeared to reference Vandermeyden in a company-wide email sent two days after her termination. In the email – with the subject “Doing the right thing”, sent at 2.29am – Musk lamented the scrutiny that his company faces, saying, “The list of companies that want to kill Tesla is so long, I’ve lost track.”As as a result, he continued, employees must work harder and faster than competitors, adding they can’t be a “jerk” in the process.Musk did not name Vandermeyden, but went on to offer what seemed to be a thinly veiled attack on her lawsuit: “If you are part of a less represented group, you don’t get a free pass on being a jerk yourself. We have had a few cases at Tesla where someone in a less represented group was actually given a job or promoted over more qualified highly represented candidates and then decided to sue Tesla for millions of dollars because they felt they weren’t promoted enough. That is obviously not cool.” Vandermeyden, who had not seen the email until the Guardian provided it to her, said it was painful to read: “It’s saying everything I’ve done at Tesla, all the hard work, it’s dismissing it all. It hurts because there are going to be some people who believe that.”She also noted that she has consistently received positive performance evaluations and called his email “defamatory”.Asked about the email, Tesla said in a statement: “This email in fact did not reference Ms Vandermeyden or her case.”Vandermeyden said she wished that Musk would consider that “dissent isn’t disloyalty” and that her love of Tesla drove her to advocate for better working conditions. “I was never your enemy,” she said, adding: “I still believe in the importance of transitioning the world to sustainable energy, but now I don’t get to be a part of it.”She recalled getting a T-shirt with Musk as a superhero when she first joined Tesla, and that it was hard to realize that “sometimes your superheroes aren’t always super”."

Today, they claim to be a 'couple madly in love' with each other.  COUPLE TRACED TO KORMANGALA APARTMENT Based on the missing complaint filed by the younger woman's family, the police initiated a search operation and traced them to an apartment in Koramangala.The couple tried to seek help of an NGO to fight their case and also to let their family and police know that they are happy together and as adults have taken their own decisions.As of now , the police is perplexed as to how to pursue this case, while the 'wife' is undergoing counseling.While many feel that the whole idea of criminalising homosexuality was to bring sanity in society, but legal experts feel that the SC order was clear that one cannot be booked for being lesbian or gay. It needs to be taken on a case by case situation.But to legally take action or even arrest, one of them needs to file a complaint or else it will not stand strong in the court.Also Read:Madrid: Hundreds of thousands march for LGBT rights in World Pride paradeDelhi: Spurned lesbian stabs lover after repeated rejectionsWATCH | India's first lesbian couple ad goes viral Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

The hackers behind the NotPetya ransomware, which wiped computers in more than 60 countries in late June, have moved more than £8,000 worth of bitcoins out of the account used to receive the ransoms.The transfer has added credence to messages purporting to be from the attackers offering to decrypt every single infected computer for a one-off payment of £200,000, after security researchers suggested they may be state-sponsored actors. It is possible to see the movement of the ransom payments thanks to the public nature of the bitcoin currency: all transfers are recorded on the public blockchain, although the real-world identities of the individuals or organisations behind a particular payment address can be near-impossible to discern.Currently, the blockchain records that the bulk of the ransom money, £7,872 worth of bitcoin, was simply transferred to a second wallet on Tuesday night, but two smaller payments, of £200 each, went to accounts used by two text-sharing websites, Pastebin and DeepPaste.Around 10 minutes before the payments were made, someone made posts on both those sites claiming to be able to decrypt hard disks infected with the malware in exchange for a payment of 100 bitcoins.The £200,000 offer has created more uncertainty about the motivations behind the ransomware. While it originally appeared to be created with the intention of earning a lot of money through ransom payments, researchers quickly pointed out that a number of features of the software made it appear that the ransom element was a smokescreen, with the real goal being widespread damage.Significantly, the majority of infections occurred in Ukraine, due to the main attack vector being a compromised version of an accounting program, ME Doc, used to file taxes in the nation. That has led to many, including the Ukrainian government, suspecting Russian involvement as part of the ongoing cyberwar between the two countries.Hackers offering to decrypt files for money suggests that the cash motivation may be more significant than thought – but that too could be misdirection.While the hackers continue to play games, the Ukrainian cybercrime unit is continuing its investigation. On Wednesday, it announced that it had seized ME Doc’s servers after “new activity” was detected there, and said it had acted to “immediately stop the uncontrolled proliferation” of malware.Cyber police spokeswoman Yulia Kvitko suggested that ME Doc had sent or was preparing to send a new update and added that swift action had prevented any further damage. “Our experts stopped (it) on time,” she said.It wasn’t immediately clear how or why hackers might still have access to ME Doc’s servers. The company has not returned messages from reporters, but in several statements took to Facebook to dispute allegations that its poor security helped seed the malware epidemic.Cyber police chief Coonel Serhiy Demydiuk previously said that ME Doc’s owners would be brought to justice, but Kvitko said there had been no arrests."
543,"The Pankaj Advani-led Indian snooker team defeated Pakistan in the final of the Asian Team Snooker Championship on Wednesday. Advani remained the only player to not lose a single individual match in the team event. This title brings up Advani's second Asian title this season and the 8th overall, while it was the first title for Advani's teammate Laxman Rawat."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowIndia's leading cueist Pankaj Advani teamed up with Laxman Rawat to demolish Pakistan in the final of the Asian Team Snooker Championship on Wednesday.Advani drew first blood by putting on a sterling performance against Mohammad Bilal.After the Pakistani scored the first solitary point and benefited from a foul from Advani, the Indian bounced back to piece together a brilliant break of 83 to seal the first tie of the best-of-five final.India's fate was going to be determined by Advani's partner Rawat's form and he did not disappoint.He rose to the occasion to head towards what was to be his first major international title with a clinical 73 break to win the frame without allowing his opponent, Babar Masih to score a single point.To complete a whitewash the Indian pair needed to maintain their superlative performance in the doubles tie.However, the Pakistani duo responded well to pressure of being 0-2 down, knowing they needed to win this crucial tie to stay alive in the final. But it was Rawat who saved the day for India by scoring a 50 break just when they had a deficit of a similar margin.But a critical miss on the pink before starting with the colours, brought Masih back to the table, gifting him a regulation clearance of yellow to black. Given the kind of pressure that was resting on his shoulders to rescue Pakistan from the brink of defeat, he fumbled on the green and gave Advani an unintended snook.But the Indian ace was in no mood of leaving the table without getting the job done. He played a classy swerve and managed to just sink the green in the pocket and saw himself in a spot of bother with the brown.A heroic attempt by Advani got him the pot and India were now just the blue and pink away from lifting the Asian title.He held his nerve and completed the task of clearing the frame and winning the final 3-0.India A comprised Malkeet Singh with Ashok Shandilya as coach.Advani remained the only player to not lose a single individual match in the team event. This title brings up Advani's second Asian title this season and 8th overall (6 Billiards, 1 6-red and 1 Team Snooker) while it is a first for Rawat and Singh.

553,The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) officials have covered the Hindi words on signboards outside metro stations after pro-Kannada organisations issued a warning in this regard expressing displeasure. The activists started online campaign #NammaMetroHindiBeda to remove Hindi signage and the BMRCL took the step to cover the Hindi words in order to avoid any more trouble.," Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe usage of Hindi in Namma Metro stations is turning into a major controversy with many Pro-Kannada organiastions at loggerheads with Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL). Ever since the online campaign #NammaMetroHindiBeda began, activists have been warning metro officials to remove Hindi signage.On Saturday, in order to avoid any more trouble, BMRCL officials allegedly covered the Hindi letters at the metro stations' entrance displays.Metro commuters were puzzled to find Hindi signs removed or covered at Chickpete and Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Metro stations' entrance gates.

Saeed's previous terror fronts Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and JuD were declared terrorist organisations by the US, after which he started running his activities under the TAJK banner. Pakistan had earlier put him on house arrest."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowAfter placing Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD)'s Hafiz Saeed under house arrest on January 30, Pakistan has now banned his new terror front Tehreek-e-Azadi-Jammu & Kashmir (TAJK).JuD was declared a terrorist outfit by the US in 2014 and and was again put under the watch list on January 27. The Pakistan's National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA ) put TAJK on the list of proscribed organisations on June 8, forcing Saeed to run his activities under the TAJK banner. Hafiz Saeed had adopted the name JuD after its terror outfit, Laskar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) that basically perpetrates terror in India, was banned by Pakistan on 14 January 2002 under international pressure.However, it did not affect him. In December 2008, the UN Security Council, under its Resolution 1267, imposed sanctions on JuD and Hafiz Saeed for supporting Al Qaeda and Taliban. India had named Hafiz Saeed, LeT and JuD as the perpetrators of the series of terrorist attacks in Mumbai in November 2008. Since then there has been an unending drama of Hafiz Saeed being put under house arrest or detained cursorily before being set free even if the US declared a bounty of USD 10 million on his head in 2012. Things took a turn after Donald Trump was elected president in the United States. The US clearly told Pakistan to act against JuD after its name prominently figured in the report of the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering. If Pakistan failed to comply to this it would be put on the list of blacklisted countries in the International Cooperative Review Group (ICRG). That would make it necessary for Pakistan to put a formal request each time it went about transacting any business through any of the international financial institutions. Left with no other option, Pakistan had to put Hafiz Saeed under house arrest on January 30. Even if symbolic, it made a huge difference that we can see now with TAJK ban, as Donald Trump is completing six months in office. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump in a joint statement, during Indian PM's US tour, labeled Pakistan a terror haven. Not to mention the US has designated Pakistan-based Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin as a global terrorist.Pakistan, probably, was expecting all this to happen, and therefore would have decided to act on Hafiz Saeed's new terror front before it became another international rallying point against it.Also Read |After Modi-Trump meet, Pakistan says US does not care about killing of innocent Kashmiris Beyond handshakes and hugs, Modi-Trump meeting meant serious business Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

The head of Iran’s atomic energy organisation, one of the architects of the 2015 landmark nuclear deal, has warned the US to stop upsetting the regional balance of power by siding with Saudi Arabia.Writing in the Guardian, Ali Akbar Salehi said “lavish arms purchases” by regional actors – a reference to the Saudi purchase of $100bn of US arms during Donald Trump’s recent visit to Riyadh – would be seen as provocative in Tehran and that it would be unrealistic to expect Iran to remain “indifferent”. Salehi, an MIT graduate scientist who has also served as foreign minister, was the second most senior Iranian negotiator, dealing with technical aspects, during nearly two years of talks between Tehran and six of the world’s major powers that led to the final nuclear accord in Vienna in July 2015.Although Trump has promised to “dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran”, he has not so far taken any concrete steps to scrap it. Last month, two days before Iran’s presidential election, his administration announced that it was continuing to waive nuclear-related sanctions under the agreement despite Washington toughening up its overall Iran policy. Salehi said it was possible to rescue the deal’s engagement if it was met with reciprocal gestures. “Often following hard-won engagement, some western nations, whether distracted by short-sighted political motivations or the lucrative inducements of regional actors, walk away and allow the whole situation to return to the status quo ante,” wrote Salehi, who is also a vice-president of Iran.Salehi warned of “chaotic behaviour” and “further tension and conflict” if the other side disregarded Iran’s security concerns, failed to adhere to its commitments and insisted on what he called alternative facts including ideas such as the “clash of civilisations”, “Sunni-Shia conflict”, “Persian-Arab enmity” and the “Arab-Israeli axis against Iran”. His article comes at a time of simmering tensions in the Middle East, where relations between Tehran and Riyadh, which are on opposite sides of many regional conflicts such as the wars in Syria and Yemen, have deteriorated. Trump’s first post-election foreign trip to Riyadh tilted the regional balance, and contributed in part to the diplomatic isolation of Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its allies, who have accused the tiny emirate of funding terrorists and appeasing Iran. Meanwhile, in Syria, Iran-backed militias and a coalition of forces led by Washington have collided a number of times in recent weeks while fighting Islamic State. “Stoking Iranophobia” or failure to deliver on promises under the deal would jeopardise engagement, Salehi wrote. “We would all end up back at square one,” he cautioned. “Unfortunately, as things stand at the moment in the region, reaching a new state of equilibrium might simply be beyond reach for the foreseeable future.”Salehi urged the outside world to take heed of the results of last month’s Iranian presidential election and the message Iranians sent, but he said “engagement is simply not a one-way street and we cannot go it alone”.

Google has started removing private medical records from its search results, after adjusting its policy regarding personal information.The change was made on Thursday to include the “confidential, personal medical records of private people” in the bracket of information Google may remove unprompted from search results. Other examples of such information include national or government issued identification numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers and images of signatures.The leaking of private medical records can be extremely damaging to the victims, both financially and emotionally, with future prospects affected and private lives of the vulnerable exposed. Given that Google’s indexing system will capture anything that’s publicly accessible on the internet, leaks such as those created by an Indian pathology lab which uploaded more than 43,000 patient records in December, including names and HIV blood test results, can be particularly damaging.The last change to the removal policy was made in 2015 with the addition of “nude or sexually explicit images that were uploaded or shared without your consent” to cover so-called revenge porn.The new addition to Google’s scrubbing policy marks a change from the search company’s traditional hands-off, algorithmic approach which resists attempts at censorship. This has come under scrutiny over the last few years due to the spread of fake news and misinformation. Google recently adjusted its search results to down-rank contested information such as fake news.For many Google has become the gateway to the internet, meaning that removal from the company’s search results effectively scrubs them from the internet. While the information will still be accessible via other search engines or directly, other associated actions including the European right to be forgotten have seen being removed from Google’s search results as good enough to affect change.Google has recently come under fire for its search and services such as YouTube being used to spread extremist content, as well as its ad network being used to fund sites dedicated to spreading hate speech and propaganda. The company introduced new measures for YouTube to tackle the spread of terrorist material, while its head of European operations apologised after adverts for major brands appeared next to extremist material."

Dravid retired from Test cricket in 2012, amassing 13,288 runs."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowRahul Dravid, one of the greatest Test batsmen in cricket's rich history, came out to bat for the first time in international cricket on June 22, 1996. It was a big occasion for Dravid, who made his Test debut against England at Lord's -- the Mecca of Cricket -- alongside Sourav Ganguly.Dravid started his debut innings at No.7 and proved his credentials with a typically gritty Test knock of 95 off 267 balls. He was also involved in a 94-run stand for the sixth wicket with centurion Ganguly (131) as the match ended in a draw. That partnership marked the start of a golden era for Indian cricket as Dravid, Ganguly, VVS Laxman along with Sachin Tendulkar took Indian cricket to new highs. (Rahul Dravid urges decisive call on MS Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh's role in team)Dravid played for 16 years for India before retiring in 2012 after India's dismal tour of Australia.

In ODIs, Dravid played 344 matches scoring 10889 with 12 hundreds and 83 half-centuries. (Rahul Dravid set to extend his tenure as India A, Under-19 coach)Dravid was famously known as 'The Wall'. The exceptional batting talent not just scored runs in India but all over the world.In one of the most memorable knocks by Dravid in 2001, the Karnataka batsman joined forces with VVS Laxman to guide India to one of best Test victories in Indian cricket's history. Dravid had a below par Test series to his standards until that innings. Following on, India were struggling to save the match tottering at 232/4 when Dravid joined an in-form Laxman at the crease. The duo put on a mammoth 376-run stand as India declared their second innings at a massive 657 for seven. Laxman had scored 281 while Dravid hit 180.Chasing 394 for a win, Australia were off to a solid opening stand before Harbhajan Singh ripped apart Australian batting line-up with 6/73 to give India a historic win to level the three-match series 1-1.Some of the interesting stats from the great man's Test career:# Dravid was involved in most number of Test victories -- 15 -- overseas with an astonishing batting average of 65.70.# He was the highest run-getter batting at No.3.

The 12 identified cases account for 25 per cent or about Rs 2 lakh crore of NPAs.IBC has defined time-frame for the resolution and there is 14-day time period for admission or rejection of a case by National Company Law Tribunal.After a case is accepted by NCLT, the creditor would get 30 days to hire insolvency practitioners and then the entire process to be completed in 180 days which will look at various possibilities including revival of projects or liquidation.RBI had set up an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) for such cases that may be considered for reference for resolution under the IBC, under which the 12 accounts were identified with fund and non-fund based outstanding amount greater than Rs 5,000 crore as of March 31, 2016.These measures were announced by RBI following an ordinance giving it wide-ranging legislative powers to fight NPAs.The ordinance authorised RBI to issue directions to banks to initiate insolvency resolution process in the event of a default under the provisions of IBC.RBI has been equipped with powers to specify one or more authorities to advise banks for dealing with the problem of NPAs which, as per the Ordinance, ""have reached unacceptably high levels and urgent measures are required for their resolution"".The law will also empower RBI to set up sector related oversight panels that will shield bankers from later action by probe agencies looking into loan recasts.RBI has expanded the oversight committee by appointing three more members to the high-level panel that will vet the process to resolve mounting bad loans bogging down the banking sector.

The video, which India Today has accesed, has is part of a campaign that the ATS plans to run with the help of celebrities.The video begins with a set of parents talking about the high hopes they have of their son and how they believe that the extended hours he spends on the internet will help him become an engineer.The parents express happiness that their son is always on his laptop, browsing the internet. Cutaways, however, show the boy coming across videos tutoring youth on how to make bombs.The video also shows the boy transferring funds to 'SYRIA', which viewers are presumably supposed to under to mean the Islamic State.An ATS team is then seen visiting the parents and telling them what their son has been actually up to online. The video ends with Sharad Kelkar, a Bollywood and television celebrity, asking parents and friends to be responsible and keep a tab on what their children/friends are doing online.Over the last few years, the Maharashtra ATS has dealt with a lot of cases where youngsters have been radicalised online and brought into the Islamic State fold.Dealing with such cases, the agency has concluded that online radicalisation is three times more effective and faster than physical indoctrination.However, keeping the complexity in mind the Maharashtra ATS has initiated a policy under which parents are requested to come forward and inform them if they see any changes in the behaviour of their children and if they find them suddenly spending a lot of time on the internet.Under the policy, ATS will not take any legal action against the children but will instead help with counseling to deradicalise them. The Maharashtra ATS has also gotten in touch with community leaders to bring the youths back into the mainstream society. Identity of youths who have been deradicalised is kept confidential.The video is another step by the agency to help expand its intelligence while stopping radicalised youths from taking any extreme steps.Notbaly, in the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has run similar awareness campaigns to prevent radicalisation of youngsters.ALSO READ | Is Pakistan indirectly paving way for ISIS in Kashmir by using its videos to fuel militancy?

A Belgian court has ruled that advertising claims about the health and environmental benefits of a palm oil-free “Choco” spread were illegal, in a case brought against the supermarket chain Delhaize by Ferrero, which manufactures Nutella.Delhaize has been ordered not to repeat any claims about its Choco spread being better for the planet or your health, on pain of a €25,000 (£22,000) fine for each repetition.Ferrero argued that the Delhaize campaign unfairly damaged its iconic Nutella brand, which was placed next to the Choco spread on the supermarket’s shelves.Delhaize, which had won an earlier court case on the issue, told the Guardian it was considering further legal actions but would not appeal the verdict.At issue is a short-lived Delhaize advertising campaign in 2013, which claimed that the Belgian outlet’s best-selling Choco spread was better for the planet and for consumer health because it contained no palm oil. Ferrero argued this implied that firms which used sustainable practices for buying palm oil within existing supply chains were ethically inferior.Greenpeace, which in 2015 rated (pdf) Ferrero one of the best of 14 global manufacturers with “no deforestation” policies, said the case had turned into a battle of sales strategies.“Ferrero is definitely one of the companies doing its best to implement sustainable commitments,” said An Lambrechts, a Greenpeace Belgium spokeswoman. “This case is more about marketing ploys and market shares and less about who has the best initiative on palm oil.”Ferrero’s use of palm oil was pushed into the spotlight in 2015 after then-French environment minister Ségolène Royal called for a consumer boycott of Nutella over deforestation concerns. Royal subsequently backed down from the call, offering the confectionery titan “a thousand apologies”.Multiple studies (pdf) have drawn causal links between the growth of palm oil plantations in south-east Asia and deforestation but the court ruled that Delhaize’s claims were unverifiable.Ferrero has a robust palm oil charter and says it can trace almost all of its palm oil to sustainable sources. The company came top of a WWF sustainability league table of 137 palm oil buyers last year. It is a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and the Palm Oil Innovation Group.“The court sustained Ferrero’s arguments that it is illegal to claim that a product without palm oil is de facto better for environment and has better nutritional qualities than one containing palm oil,” a spokesman for Ferrero said.“Ferrero has taken admirable steps to reduce the impact of palm oil within its supply chain,” said Glenn Hurowitz, the CEO of Mighty, which campaigns against deforestation caused by palm oil. “But it is as yet impossible to delink one company’s supplies from the broader, continued deforestation of the palm oil industry as a whole.”A separate argument by Ferrero that Delhaize not be allowed to call their spread “Choco” – because it contains no chocolate – was thrown out by the court.For its part, Delhaize said Choco was still being manufactured with sunflower oil, cocoa butter and coconut oil – and packaged as palm oil-free.“We have not seen any impact on [Choco] sales. On the contrary,” said the firm’s communications director Roel Dekelver. “Despite this judgement, we will continue to propose and present innovative and inspirational products to customers that answer their different needs. This won’t hold us back.” The Belgian supermarket, which merged with Ahold to create a €40bn retail empire last year, had also alleged health benefits from palm-oil free produce, citing “potential health concerns” from palm oil in an assessment by the European Food Safety Authority.However, this assessment also applied to other vegetable oils and products, and the analysis is currently being reassessed. Ian Barber, the communications director of the Advertising Association, said that the first rule of advertising was: “If you can’t back up the claim, you can’t make it”. “I’d imagine the strategy open to Delhaize now is just to advertise that they’re palm oil-free and leave world to make up its mind if that’s a good or a bad thing,” he said.

"," Jump to navigationSpeak NowWashington, Jun 7 (PTI) Scientists have discovered a 3,000-year-old rectangular copper mask in Argentina - one of the oldest human-made metal object from South America.The mask, that dates back to about 1000 BC, was found at a site where adults and children were buried.Holes mark the position of the masks eyes, nose and mouth, with additional small, circular openings near the edges that could have been threaded to secure it to a face or an object.Scientists from University of Buenos Aires in Argentina also found a source of copper ore within 70 kilometres of the location where the mask was uncovered, suggesting that it was produced locally.It is probable that metalworking emerged in Argentina at the same time that it was developing in Peru, the researchers wrote in the study published in the journal Antiquity.The metal mask - along with a collection of human bones ? was found in a tomb near a village in northwestern Argentina.There were about 14 bodies in the burial area, with the bones all mixed together and the mask placed on top of one corner of the pile.Another burial area nearby held a single occupant. The bones of a child about 8 to 12 years old, also dating to about 3,000 years ago, were buried with a stone bead and a copper pendant, Live Science reported.The mask measures about 18 centimetres long and nearly 15 cm wide. To create the mask, someone would have hammered the metal flat while it was cold and then reheated it, researchers said.The age of these metal objects - particularly the mask, crafted to deliberately resemble a human face - strongly suggests that people in the Argentinian regions of the Andes were shaping copper into artifacts earlier than previously thought, they said.

The reason Maharashtra government is looking for this notification is because a bunch of petitions have been filed by liquor vendors and restaurant owners claiming that the excise department is now not renewing their licenses to sell or serve liquor as the department claims they are located on the highways.It was in December last year that the Supreme Court in its landmark judgment of State of Tamil Nadu V/s. K. Balu and others had directed for not issuing license to liquor shops and permit rooms within distance of 500 mtrs form the national and state highways.  By the said judgment the apex court had also directed for not renewing license of existing shops and for not issuing new license for such shops after 31st March, 2017 along national and state highways.The petitioners claim that the bars, restaurants and wine shops are neither situated on a national highway nor on a state highway, but is located in by-lanes of the city, more than 500 meters from the highways.  For example, one of the petitioners is King Wines, which is located in the heart of Kolhapur city. The petitioner submits that recently, their licenses were renewed for this year on accepting requisite license fees by the district collector and superintendent of state excise in Kolhapur. However, the same authorities, after renewal, directed the wine shop owner to forthwith, stop all their business owing to Supreme Court's order.  Thus, during the last hearing on May 31st the division bench of Justice B P Colabawalla and Justice A M Badar had asked for the notification. Advocate Shrikrishna Ganbavale who is appearing for the petitioners explained, ""There has to be a notification from state government that this road or that road is a national highway or a state highway. Without that the state government cannot arbitrarily close down business establishments. That is why they have been asked to show the notifications.""The court has granted the state government time till Monday to get these notifications and has even asked the advocate general of Maharashtra to appear before them.ALSO READ:Kerala changes liquor policy, 3-star and above hotels can now serve booze Udta Bihar: Huge spike in substance abuse, alcohol bootlegging year after ban Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

Now Warner’s up. He begins by revisiting the “smear” of Comey’s character following his firing. Warner is going to talk about Comey’s meeting with the president. He starts with the first meeting Comey described, in which Comey briefed the president on the Steele dossier.Why did Comey decide to document that discussion. What was it about that meeting?Comey replies:“A combination of things. The circumstances, the subject matter and the person I was interacting with.”Comey says he was alone with the president-elect discussing weighty matters.Then:I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it was important to document it.Updated

Burr asks Comey whether he doubts that the congressional committee plus Bob Mueller can get to the bottom of the Russia affair.No doubt, Comey says. 

10.35am EDT
10:35

Burr is back to Comey’s decision to talk about Clinton’s emails. He asks whether attorney general Loretta Lynch’s tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton influenced his decision.“That was the thing that capped it for me, that I had to do something separately,” Comey said.Comey says he was “confused and concerned” that Lynch directed Comey to call the Clinton email affair not an investigation but a “matter.” That was “one of the bricks in the load” that convinced him to act unilaterally, he said. 

10.33am EDT
10:33

Question: When did you first become aware of Russian cyberintrusion?A: There were a lot of them. Late summer 2015. “There was a massive effort.”Comey says Russians targeted “hundreds, I suppose it could be more than a thousand” entities in an attempt to crack the US election.He says in late 2015 or early 2016 he became aware that data had been exfiltrated.He says the FBI undertook an effort to notify victims of the “massive spearfishing campaign.”Comey says the Obama administration was looking for ways to fight the cyberattack. This all happened out of the public view, of course, while Comey stepped forward to give multiple updates in the Clinton emails inquiry.

10.30am EDT

Comey: In any complex investigation, when you start turning over rocks, sometimes you find things unrelated to the primary investigation that are criminal in nature.

Burr turns to Michael Flynn. He says Flynn had unreported contacts with the Russians.Was general Flynn at that time in serious legal jeopardy. Do you think the president was trying to obstruct justice or just give Flynn a way to save face?“Obstruct justice” – Burr’s phrase.Comey says it’s not for him to say whether what the president did amounts to obstruction. 

10.26am EDT
10:26

Burr asked Comey whether the special counsel, Robert Mueller, reviewed his testimony.No.Comey says he has “no doubt” that the Russian government was behind various intrusions in the election and attempts to tamper.Are you confident that no votes... were altered?Comey: “I’m confident.”Did the president ask you to stop the Russia investigation?Not to my understanding, no.

In a poignant moment, Comey tells his former colleagues he is “so sorry” he wasn’t able to say goodbye to them.Then he offers his testimonial:“The FBI is honest, the FBI is strong, and the FBI is and always will be independent.”"

Australia’s consumer watchdog carried out a sting operation against Apple which it says caught staff repeatedly misleading iPhone customers about their legal rights to a free repair or replacement after a so-called “error 53” malfunction, court documents reveal.Australian authorities lodged a high-profile case against Apple this year, after iPhone and iPad customers experienced a malfunction that rendered phones useless if it detects that a repair has been carried out by a non-Apple technician. The fault occurred between late 2014 until early last year.The case, set to go to trial in mid-December, accuses Apple of wrongly telling customers they were not entitled to free replacements or repair if they had taken their devices to an unauthorised third-party repairer.'Error 53' is a message that occurred after updating to iOS 9.0 on iPhones of people who had had their TouchID fingerprint sensor replaced by a repair shop not licensed by Apple. The phones were rendered useless because the operating system update detected a mismatch between the sensor and the phone, and locked the device, assuming unauthorised access was being attempted. Eventually, Apple issued a fix which rendered affected phones usable again, while keeping TouchID disabled on those devices.That advice was allegedly given even where the repair – a screen replacement, for example – was not related to the fault.Apple has so far chosen to remain silent about the case brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). But court documents obtained by Guardian Australia show the company has denied the ACCC’s allegations, saying it did not mislead or cause any harm to its Australian customers.The documents also show how the ACCC used undercover methods to investigate Apple. Investigators, posing as iPhone customers, called all 13 Apple retailers across Australia in June last year.They told Apple staff their iPhone speakers had stopped working after screens were replaced by a third party.Apple’s response was the same in each of the 13 calls, the ACCC alleges.“In each call, Apple Australia represented to the ACCC caller that no Apple entity ... was required to, or would, remedy the defective speaker at no cost under the [Australian consumer law] if the screen of the iPhone had been replaced by someone other than Apple Australia or an Apple-authorised service provider,” the ACCC’s court claim alleged. Error 53 generally occurred after a user tried to update their phone to iOS 8 or iOS 9, and affected about one in every 1,000 phones supplied by Apple or its resellers between September 2014 and February 2016. Australian consumer law clearly protects the right of a customer to a replacement or free repair if the product is faulty or of unacceptable quality. The ACCC has also alleged information on Apple US’s website misled customers about their rights. The website told users experiencing error 53 that: “If the screen or any other part on your iPhone or iPad was replaced somewhere else, contact Apple Support about pricing information for out-of-warranty repairs.”Apple, in response, said the undercover calls made by the ACCC cannot be considered as breaches because consumer law does not exist in “hypothetical circumstances”. The company said that real customers who had called the store would have received other information from Apple that informed them of their rights under consumer law. Apple denied the message on its US website was an “express representation” that consumers were not entitled to a free replacement or repair. Apple said the website was referring only to the conditions of the company’s own limited warranty, which existed in addition to a customer’s statutory rights. It was only one part of the communications between the company and its customers over error 53, the company said, and must be interpreted in the broader context. Apple said it had also established an error 53 outreach program and offered replacements or repairs for many of the phones referred to in the ACCC’s case. It also released an update in February last year to resolve the problem and restore the functionality of affected devices. Apple has previously faced court action in the United States relating to error 53, but the case was thrown out last year. "

660,"""Tesla has fired engineer AJ Vandermeyden who accused the automaker of ignoring her complaints of sexual harassment and paying her less than her male counterparts. Vandermeyden had claimed she was taunted and catcalled by male employees. The company argued that she received special treatment at the expense of others, yet chose to """"pursue a miscarriage of justice by suing Tesla.""""""","Lawyer for AJ Vandermeyden says termination was retaliatory after she took lawsuit public, accusing the company of discriminationA female engineer at Tesla who accused the car manufacturer of ignoring her complaints of sexual harassment and paying her less than her male counterparts has been fired in what her lawyer alleges was an act of retaliation.AJ Vandermeyden, who went public with her discrimination lawsuit against Elon Musk’s car company in an interview with the Guardian in February, was dismissed from the company this week.Vandermeyden had claimed she was taunted and catcalled by male employees and that Tesla failed to address her complaints about the harassment, unequal pay and discrimination. “It’s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to have,” she said at the time.In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired Vandermeyden, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee’s allegations with the help of a “a neutral, third-party expert” and concluded her complaints were unmerited.“Despite repeatedly receiving special treatment at the expense of others, Ms Vandermeyden nonetheless chose to pursue a miscarriage of justice by suing Tesla and falsely attacking our company in the press,” a Tesla spokesperson said. “After we carefully considered the facts on multiple occasions and were absolutely convinced that Ms Vandermeyden’s claims were illegitimate, we had no choice but to end her employment at Tesla.”“This was absolutely shocking for AJ. She is devastated,” Therese Lawless, Vandermeyden’s attorney, said by phone. “She brought the lawsuit in an attempt to make the workplace at Tesla more equitable and fair and to have Tesla comply with the law.”Asked about Tesla’s justification for the firing, Lawless said: “They’ve just proven our case. It’s clear retaliation.” She added: “Somebody is trying to instill in employees that when they speak out about matters they are legally allowed to speak out about, they too will be fired.” Vandermeyden’s firing is likely to reignite debate over employment standards in Silicon Valley, where startups and major tech corporations are grappling with complaints of systemic wage disparities, gender discrimination and sexual misconduct.An account of alleged sexism at Uber went viral earlier this year, fueling debate about harassment in the industry, while a recent federal lawsuit against Google has placed a spotlight on concerns about tech firms underpaying women.  Lawless, who represented the former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao in her high-profile discrimination lawsuit, against the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, said she intended to file a formal retaliation complaint on behalf of Vandermeyden. “It is illegal in the state of California for an employer to retaliate against an employee who asserts her rights, including her rights to receive equal pay as her male colleagues.” Vandermeyden, who started working at Tesla in 2013, claims in her lawsuit that she was paid less than male engineers whose work she directly took over as a manufacturing engineer in the general assembly department.Her complaint further alleged that she raised issues about flaws in the quality testing of cars that her supervisors and male engineers had missed. Although she came up with a solution, men were granted positions over her, she alleged. The complaint said that she and other female engineers were denied promotions despite the fact that they were “equally or more qualified” than the men.Vandermeyden also alleged that she experienced “unwelcome and pervasive harassment by men on the factory floor including but not limited to inappropriate language, whistling, and catcalls”.Further, the lawsuit accused Tesla of retaliating against her for speaking up. Management allegedly told her that in order to advance her position, she would need to achieve a performance standard in the factory that was not expected of male engineers and was unattainable. Although she had positive performance evaluations, she felt she had to transfer out of general assembly to the purchasing department, according to the lawsuit, which also said that Tesla retaliated against her for being a “whistleblower”. Tesla has continued to strongly reject Vandermeyden’s claims. A spokesperson said the company had “conducted a thorough internal investigation” and “extensively re-reviewed all the facts”, repeatedly concluding that her allegations were false. Tesla added that Vandermeyden had been granted numerous positions “over other more qualified candidates” and was “given special treatment and opportunities for advancement that were unwarranted based on her qualifications”.“The termination was based on Ms Vandermeyden behaving in what the evidence indicates is a fundamentally false and misleading manner, not as a result of retaliation for the lawsuit,” the spokesperson added. “It is impossible to trust anyone after they have behaved in such a manner and therefore continued employment is also impossible.”The Vandermeyden case is one of several labor issues that have dogged Tesla, which is facing growing scrutiny over its practices in California. Earlier this month, the Guardian published an investigation into working conditions at Tesla’s “factory of the future” in Fremont, California, where several factory workers complained about their treatment at the plant.Incident reports revealed that ambulances have been called more than 100 times since 2014 for workers experiencing fainting spells, seizures, dizziness, abnormal breathing and chest pains. A recent report from a worker safety organization found that Tesla workers were injured at a rate 31% higher than the industry average in 2015.The company has said it has significantly improved safety standards in recent months at the factory, and Musk told the Guardian he cared deeply about the health and wellbeing of his employees. Vandermeyden, in her interview with the Guardian in February, emphasized that she believed Tesla was a “revolutionary and innovative company” and said she took out a hefty loan to buy the cheapest version of the Model S car.“Until somebody stands up, nothing is going to change,” she added. “I’m an advocate of Tesla. I really do believe they are doing great things. That said, I can’t turn a blind eye if there’s something fundamentally wrong going on.”At the time, Vandermeyden said she was hopeful her lawsuit and public comments would not end her career at the company. But she expressed some concern that her decision to speak out could result in retaliation. “Half the time when I walk into work,” she said, “I wonder if my badge is going to work.”Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"

The parents of a dead 15-year-old who appealed to Facebook to allow them access to her account to see if she was being bullied before her death have lost their claim in court.Berlin’s court of appeal ruled on Wednesday that the parents of the teenager, who died in 2012 after falling in front of an underground train, had no claim to access her details or chat history. The ruling goes against the decision made in an initial judgment by the regional court in 2015. It raises fresh questions over digital inheritance and who has the right to manage someone’s online presence and intellectual property when they die.The court said it had made the ruling according to the telecommunications secrecy law which precludes heirs from viewing the communications of a deceased relative with a third party. Before the ruling both Facebook and the parents of the girl, whose identity has not been made public, reserved the right in the event of a defeat to take an appeal to Germany’s federal court of justice in Karlsruhe. The judge said they were free to do so, but the parents have not confirmed that this is what they still intend to do.The family have said they are desperate to find out whether the girl’s death in Berlin was suicide and, if so, whether it was the consequence of online bullying. They have said they want Facebook to allow access to chats she might have had online which might provide a clue as to the cause of their daughter’s unexpected death.The girl had reportedly given her mother the login details to her account when she was 14 but the company, having been informed of the girl’s death by one of her Facebook friends, froze or “memorialised” her account. The move meant that photos and posts the girl had shared remained visible, and friends could pay tribute to her, but it was no longer possible to log in to the account. Facebook has refused to say who applied for the account to be frozen, also citing data protection. The person who lodged the request would have had to provide Facebook with proof that the girl had died. The US social media company has repeatedly rejected the parents’ request, arguing that in the event messages from a user are revealed, other users would also be exposed. They argue that the conversations would have taken place on the understanding that their content remained private.In its 2015 ruling, Berlin’s regional court ruled in favour of the mother, arguing that the contents of the daughter’s Facebook account should be owned by her heirs. The judge insisted then that Facebook chats should be regarded no differently to the girl’s letters and diaries which her parents automatically inherited. Facebook appealed against that ruling, which is why the case was heard by the court of appeal. The ruling on Wednesday was based on weighing up inheritance laws drawn up almost 120 years ago and the rights of parents towards minors, with the telecommunications secrecy law introduced to protect the privacy of telephone conversations which was updated by the constitutional court in 2009 to include emails. Björn Retzlaff, the judge who ruled in Berlin, deemed that the same rules applied to internet chats. “That is at the centre of our decision,” Retzlaff told the court, stressing at the same time that the decision had been a difficult one.In a statement in German to the media Facebook said it welcomed the ruling, adding: “At the same time we are sympathetic towards the family and respect their wish. We are making every effort to find a solution which helps the family at the same time as protecting the privacy of third parties who are also affected by this.”The case recalls that of an Italian architect who appealed to Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, last year to unblock his dead 13-year-old son’s iPhone so he could download the photographs stored on it.

India have played the tournament in all the previous seven editions finishing on top twice while ending runners-up once.Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and most lately Shikhar Dhawan have been key to India's rise at the multi-nation tournament. Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and Ishant Sharma have been the among the top wicket-takers at the event while MS Dhoni is the most successful Indian wicket-keeper.This time they will go into the tournament as defending champions and would look to create history by becoming the first team to win the championship thrice.Here's a look at India's journey at the top ICC event:1998 Wills International Cups (Bangladesh) - SEMI-FINALSIndia fielded a strong side with Mohammad Azharuddin as captain. The side boasted of a strong batting line-up with the likes of Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Ajay Jadeja and Robin Singh in the side. Javagal Srinath spearheading the pace attack while Anil Kumble looked after the spin department.However, India were knocked out in semi-finals by West Indies, who were led by Brian Lara.2000 ICC KnockOut (Kenya) - RUNNERS-UPSourav Ganguly's 117 went in vain in the big final as Chris Cairns' 102 not out guided New Zealand to a four-wicket win to hand Kiwis the trophy. Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan made their debuts for India in the tournament.2002 ICC Champions Tropy (Sri Lanka) - CHAMPIONS (Shared)India, under Sourav Ganguly, went a step further by becoming the joint champions with Sri Lanka after the final was rained-off twice. In the final, Sri Lanka posted 244/5 with Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara scoring a fifty each. In reply, India started off well and were 14/0 in two overs when rain halted the proceedings and no further play was possible that day.On the reserve day, Sri Lanka again won the toss and batted first. This time Mahela Jayawardene and Russell Arnold struck fifties to help Sri Lanka post 222/7 in their 50 overs. In response, Virender Sehwag looked at his menacing best with 25 not out off 22 balls when heavy rain stopped play. Once again the persistent rain denied a result and the trophy was awarded to both Sri Lanka and India.2004 ICC Champions Trophy (England) - GROUP STAGEIndia failed to go beyond the group stage. India started off their campaign with a thunderous 98-run win over Kenya but a three-wicket defeat against Pakistan was enough to stop Ganguly's men from advancing to the semi-finals.2006 ICC Champions Trophy (India) - GROUP STAGEIndia's batting line-up failed to fire in the big tournament at home. They managed to beat England in their first game but their star-studded batting continued to misfire and consecutive defeats against West Indies and Australia left them with just one win in the tournament.2009 ICC Champions Trophy (South Africa) - GROUP STAGEIndia again failed to impress. Rahul Dravid-led side started with a 54-run loss against Pakistan while their next game against Australia yielded no result because of rain. In their third group match, India beat West Indies to finish with three points in the table but it was not enough to get them through to the semi-finals.2013 ICC Champions Trophy (England and Wales) - CHAMPIONSIndia started the tournament with three successive failures at the event. However, this time they were a form side with the likes of Shikhar Dhawan and Ravindra Jadeja grabbing all the limelight. They remained unbeaten in the their pool with comfortable victories over South Africa, West Indies and Pakistan. In the semi-finals, MS Dhoni's men annihilated Sri Lanka by eight wickets. However, the final was a curtailed affair. It was reduced to 20-overs-a-side game and put in to bat, India managed to score 129/7. But a stepped up performances by the bowlers handed India a five-run win and the trophy, making MS Dhoni the only captain to win all three ICC events after his triumphs at the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and 2011 ICC World Cup.It will be the first major ICC tournament for Virat Kohli as the captain of the Indian team and his first assignment starts when the defending champions lock horns with arch-rivals Pakistan at Edgbaston on June 4.

671,"Charles Rolls, the Co-founder of upmarket tonic water maker Fever-Tree, sold a stake of around 4% in the company for �73 million (around ?602 crore). Rolls cashed in the shares that have risen over 50% this year alone and are currently up 924% since its IPO in late 2014. After the sale, Rolls still owns around 11.2% of the company.","Charles Rolls, who launched premium tonic brand with Tim Warrillow, cashes in on soaring stock market valueFever-Tree, the upmarket tonic water maker, suffered the rarest of hiccups in its meteoric rise after co-founder Charles Rolls cashed in £73m of shares.The sale left the company’s stock down 2% at £17.12 on Thursday – but that is still nearly 13 times its £1.34 price tag when it floated less than three years ago.Demand for the shares from City investors was so great that Rolls offloaded 4.5m shares, a 3.9% stake, having initially planned to release 2.5m.He retains an 11.2% holding worth £222m, and the company is valued at nearly £2bn.That means Fever-Tree is worth more than Britvic, its 170-year old rival, more than the UK arm of Domino’s Pizza, and about three times as much as the Debenhams store chain.That is astonishing for a business with sales of just £100m and only 46 full-time staff that has done little more than concoct a fancy mixer for gin. But it is testament to the super-speed growth the company has delivered since Rolls and co-founder Tim Warrillow launched it in 2005.From a standing start, the duo became millionaires within a decade, selling £25m of stock between them when they floated the company on the AIM market in 2014. Rolls has cashed out to the tune of £100m, because he also sold a £12m tranche of shares last year.He owes not just his fortune but apparently his life to tonic water – or at least to its key medicinal ingredient, quinine. He once contracted malaria during a trip to Africa and has credited the chemical, obtained from the bark of the cinchona tree referenced in the company’s name, with saving his life.Though the company started out with tonic water, it has expanded to include variants on the drink, as well as Sicilian lemonade and ginger ale.It has managed to stand out from the crowd by consciously embracing luxury status, making much of the exotic origin of its ingredients and the great expense of getting them into your glass.Its ginger comes from Ivory Coast and Nigeria, its lemons from Sicily, and Warrillow once braved checkpoints manned by militiamen to source quinine from a remote part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.These are the credentials that have ensured no luxury hotel or Michelin-starred restaurant is without a supply of Fever-Tree in its mixer cabinet.Indeed, one of the company’s early customers was world-renowned chef Ferran Adrià, who made its tonic a firm fixture in his restaurant El Bulli, rated by many gastronomes as the world’s best and quirkiest restaurant before it served up its last liquid olive in 2011.Posh tonic has also benefited from a serendipitous resurgence in gin, increasingly seen as a sophisticated spirit worth splashing out on.Gin menus are a common feature of bars in countries where the spirit is particularly popular such as the UK, Spain and US. And premium gins demand to be mixed with premium tonics.Fever-Tree has ridden the crest of this alcoholic wave like no other company, reporting pre-tax profits last year that more than doubled to £34.3m on sales of £102m.This month, the company announced that its 2017 results would comfortably exceed City forecasts, indicating that the Fever-Tree star is still very much in the ascendancy.Rolls, a former management consultant who revived the Plymouth Gin brand, and Warrilow, a former ad man, teamed up in an attempt to challenge the domination by Schweppes of the mixers market.Rolls had noticed that the world’s finest gins were mixed with the same mass-produced tonic. “There’s no point having a good gin if the tonic isn’t right,” he said, pointing out that tonic makes up the lion’s share of a G&T, at least if it is made right.This year, Rolls ended his day-to-day involvement in the company, moving from executive deputy chairman to a non-executive position.That might explain why he feels able to start cashing in, a decision that might have given investors pause for thought if he were still engaged in building the business.And with an extra £73m in the bank, Rolls has little reason to wait until the sun is past the yard-arm for his first G&T of the day."

678,The Delhi High Court has directed the CBSE to continue with its moderation policy of giving students grace marks for difficult questions. The court ruled this following a petition which challenged that the change in policy will affect students' admissions abroad. The court asked CBSE to continue the policy as it was in place when the examination forms were submitted.," Jump to navigationSpeak NowNew Delhi, May 23 (PTI) In a major relief to students who have just taken Class 12 examinations, the Delhi High Court today directed the CBSE to follow its moderation policy of giving grace marks to students for difficult questions.The court asked the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to continue with the policy which was in place when the examination forms were submitted last year.A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Pratibha M Singh passed the interim order on a PIL filed by a parent and a lawyer contending that the policy should not be done away with this year, as decided by some states, since it would affect the students of Class 12, particularly those who have applied for admissions abroad.The petition had said that the policy was changed by way of a notification by CBSE after the exams for the year were held and hence would have a drastic impact on the students.Yesterday, the high court had termed as ""unfair and irresponsible"" the CBSEs decision to scrap its moderation policy under which grace marks are given to students in exams for difficult questions and had asked why it cannot be implemented from next year.The decision of the CBSE, which would come into effect from this year, ""would have a drastic effect on the students,"" the court had said.It had also asked the Board why it cannot implement the change in policy from next year as the results of the 2016-17 exams are expected to be announced in a few days.

For others the terror was all too immediately apparent.The lights had just come on and Ariana Grande had left the stage after concluding an elaborate three-hour, four-part entertainment extravaganza with an encore performance of her latest single, Dangerous Woman.At 10.30pm following a sold-out show in the 21,000-capacity Manchester Arena, thousands of fans began to gather up their belongings and filter slowly out of four exits.Then the bang.For the first milliseconds, minds did not immediately connect the sound with an explosion or a bomb.“It sounded like a big balloon popping, but it was kind of muffled, like it wasn’t in the stadium itself,” said a young Mancunian fan, identified as Sammy, in a video he recorded of his experience and posted on Periscope.“There were a few screams, then there was silence. Then the whole arena literally split like the Red Sea – everyone was trampling over each other, sprinting to get to the nearest exit. It was like a scene out of a horror movie.”"

682,"A professional hunter from South Africa died on Friday after an elephant he was hunting fell on top of him. The deceased, 51-year-old Theunis Botha, was with a group of hunters when an elephant picked him up. One of the hunters then shot the elephant, which collapsed on top of Botha and crushed him to death."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe elephant, after being fatally shot, collapsed on top of the professional South African hunter. There is an idiom that elders often throw around: Pick on someone your own size. The keyword here is 'size'.A professional South African hunter in Zimbabwe, who specialised in 'big game' hunting, ended up being crushed to death under an elephant that had been shot.Theunis Botha, 51, was hunting at the Hwange National Park with his group, when he crossed paths with a herd of pregnant elephants. The elephants did not quite like this sudden meet-up with gun-carrying humans, and so, came charging at the hunters.In retaliation, Botha started firing at the charging animals. What he did not see, however, is that one elephant was coming towards him from the side. Before Botha knew it, he was up in the air by this elephant's trunk.Seeing this, one of the other hunters shot the elephant swinging Botha by its trunk, but they probably did not see how this could end. The wounded elephant released Botha, dropped him to the ground, and then collapsed right on top of him.Needless to say, Botha did not survive the crush.The 51-year-old late hunter was known for taking ""wealthy American clients"" for hunting tours in Zimbabwe, where they could ""shoot for trophies"".Botha also specialised in hunting leopards, lions, etc. and in using dogs to chase animals into his shooting range. He is said to have been friends with hunter Scott Van Zyl, who made headlines recently after being eaten by crocodiles. Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

Conflict, violence and natural disasters forced more than 31 million people to leave home and settle elsewhere within their countries last year, the equivalent of one person every second.But while the number of people uprooted by conflict outnumbers refugees by two to one, they have been largely ignored by the international community, according to a report by the Norwegian Refugee Council’s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. Alexandra Bilak, director of the IDMC, said that while resources had rightly been devoted to the refugee crisis, scant attention had been paid to people forced to resettle. “Not including internal displacement as an integral part of that entire displacement and migration picture is very shortsighted, because by looking only at the point of arrival and not considering where those journeys started, inevitably you’re missing part of the picture,” she said. “If you redirect attention to the countries of origin and to really understanding the driving forces of these movements it would be a much more strategic approach and investment,” added Bilak.Last year, an estimated 6.9 million people were forced to leave their homes as a result of conflict and violence. Worst affected was the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 922,000 were displaced, a 50% rise on the previous year. Close behind was Syria (824,000), followed by Iraq (659,000), Afghanistan (653,000), Nigeria (501,000) and Yemen (478,000).Disasters such as floods, storms and wildfires had an even greater effect, displacing 24.2 million people, more than three times the number uprooted by conflict. This trend was at its most acute in east Asia and the Pacific. In China, 7.4 million were forced from their homes, with 5.9 million affected in the Philippines and a further 2.4 million in India. Floods accounted for half of all people displaced by disasters. In some cases, a complex mix of conflict and disaster has forced communities from their homes, the report’s authors noted. It pointed to the situations unfolding in Nigeria, South Sudan and Somalia, where drought combined with conflict and violence are fuelling displacement, severe food insecurity and famine. Bilak said the number of displacements due to violence in DRC was proof that the underlying conflicts cannot be ignored. “Unless the crisis and the factors that lead to this crisis are addressed they will re-erupt on a cyclical basis.”In May last year, the UN proposed (pdf) that governments commit to reducing the number of internally displaced people by at least 50% by 2030. The report warned this is little more than an aspiration, however.Last year, more aid was spent on refugee resettlement within donor nations than in the countries where displacement crises originated.“What we focus on is the symptom of this breakdown of protection and human rights of people in their local communities. We just focus on the symptom, which is the people we see at our borders,” said Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council.He said there is a link with refugees – though the vast majority of displaced people do not have the opportunity or means to cross borders.Six of the 10 countries that produced the most refugees in 2015 – Afghanistan, Colombia, DRC, South Sudan and Syria – were also among the 10 with the largest number of internally displaced people.Egeland warned that without political intervention the situation will only get worse. “First, conflict resolution needs to be redoubled, tripled, quadrupled,” he said. “It’s incredible there’s not a bigger pull towards a peaceful settlement of the Yemeni conflict. We also need to get economic life to countries like Yemen and elsewhere so there’s not a collapse in social structures there. Then we need investment in avoiding environmental degradation, and we need disaster risk reduction.”"

Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has reportedly been forced to order his ministers to attend the airport reception for Donald Trump on Monday, after discovering that a number had planned not to attend.According to reports in the Israeli media, an angry Netanyahu was informed on Sunday that party heads and a number of ministers planned to skip the reception after the White House had asked for the meet and greet to be shortened to the two countries’ anthems and handshakes only between Netanyahu and Trump.Haaretz, the Times of Israel and the Jerusalem Post all carried stories, some quoting an identified Israeli government official on the instruction from Netanyahu, amid claims that ministers had been upset at not being included in the receiving line on the airport tarmac.The row is the latest in a series of controversies to hit the planned visit of the US president, which officials in Israel have privately characterised as often haphazard.Trump will arrive for the whirlwind visit to Israel and to the occupied Palestinian territories on Monday, amid mounting questions over what – if any – practical steps he will take to advance his “ultimate peace deal” between the two sides.Overshadowed by the escalating scandals surrounding him, the US president will meet Netanyahu and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, during 26 hours of events.Trump will arrive from Riyadh on Air Force One just before noon at Ben Gurion airport, accompanied by his wife, Melania, daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared, before flying by helicopter to Jerusalem.During his visit, Trump will briefly visit the Holocaust memorial at Yad Vashem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City, dine with Netanyahu and make a private visit to the Western Wall, Judaism’s most holy site. Then on Tuesday morning Trump will meet Abbas in Bethlehem before flying on to Rome.Speaking at his weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, ahead of Trump’s arrival, Netanyahu said: “I will discuss with President Trump ways to strengthen our primary and steadfast ties with the United States. We will improve our security ties, which we are strengthening on a daily basis. We will also discuss ways to advance the peace.”The visit will take place under tight security with about 10,000 police securing the Israeli part of the visit, which will be accompanied by road closures. Trump will spend a single night in a suite in the King David hotel protected by glass capable of withstanding a rocket-propelled grenade and a poison gas attack. The visit comes at a tense time ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Six Day War in early June – which for Palestinians marks five decades of occupation – and amid a continuing hunger strike by hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails that has prompted sometimes violent demonstrations on the West Bank.Trump’s problems at home are also seen by some as having cast a pall over the proceedings, with Dan Shapiro, the former US ambassador to Israel under Barack Obama, predicting: “I think the trip’s in a lot of jeopardy [in] being able to be productive because of all the chaos and controversy that’s going on in Washington.” Despite the signs posted in Jerusalem neighbourhoods welcoming Trump as “a friend of Zion” and calling on hims to “make Israel great”, his visit is also causing anxieties for many on Israel’s right for whom Trump’s election was seen initially as the cause for unbridled celebration. Since his inauguration on 20 January, those same rightwingers fear that Trump has drifted towards an ever more conventional US foreign policy position on the peace process.Far from moving the US embassy to Jerusalem on his first day in office – as he promised – Trump has kicked that issue into the long grass while expressing a sometimes garbled objection to Israeli settlement building.That has seen David Friedman, the controversial and pro-settler new US ambassador to Israel who arrived last week, move quickly to reassure Netanyahu’s government that Trump remains as firmly committed to Israel as ever, even as he suggested that no announcement on the US embassy would be made until after Trump’s visit.The messaging on the Israel-Palestine peace process has also been downbeat, with one US official telling Haaretz on Sunday that the height of Trump’s ambitions for his “ultimate deal” right now appears to involve no more than encouraging the two sides to play nicely to create conditions for direct talks.“The president has made a general statement regarding his view on settlements and he hopes the Israeli government takes it into account,” the official said. “He was also pretty direct with President Abbas regarding what they need to do regarding incitement and the payments to families of terrorists. He has been quite clear about that and he will be clear about that during the visit.”Instead, the expectation will be that Trump will neither outline a vision for a framework for the peace process nor any concrete steps. What noises that have emerged from reported leaks about Trump’s plans to advance peace suggest an implausible mishmash of ideas – including the idea that Israel be allowed to continue settlement building during talks.On the Israeli side the most significant outcome is a proposal for improving the economic quality of life for Palestinians on the West Bank, including longer opening hours for the Allenby Bridge crossing to Jordan, more building permits in the so-called area C and suggestions for new industrial zones on the West Bank.Lacking any clear prospects for a breakthrough, the runup to the visit has been dominated by mini – and sometimes concocted – controversies including the comment by a US official telling Netanyahu’s office that the Western Wall was not in Israeli territory.Trump will, however, become the first US president to visit the wall, a fact that was being spun last week by Jonathan Schanzer of the rightwing US Foundation for Defence of Democracies as a pro-Israel step.“I think that if Trump himself goes to the Western Wall and does it with Israeli officials, even Israeli security, there’s going to be very little argument over who controls it – certainly [when] going there to acknowledge it as a Jewish holy site,” said Schanzer.On the Palestinian side, officials appear content that the worst predictions regarding Trump on the Middle East – fuelled by his own campaign rhetoric – have not materialised. “We’re happy that, contrary to initial expectations, the Trump administration has been willing to listen,” one official said. “Our readout is that Trump was surprised by Abbas’s declaration of his willingness to make peace, having being told the opposite by some of his advisers.”"

690,"""Confectionery multinational Nestl� has lost its bid against Cadbury to register the shape of the four-finger KitKat chocolate as a trademark, marking its fourth unsuccessful attempt to do so. The court ruled the four-finger design had """"no inherent distinctiveness"""" and the shape was not a """"badge or origin"""". This will let competitors produce their own KitKat copies without legal consequences.""","Court of appeal rules against Nestlé in its protracted battle with Cadbury over whether format should be protected by lawIt’s enough to make anyone need a sit-down with a cup of tea and a four-fingered chocolate wafer biscuit. The confectionery multinational Nestlé has lost the latest round of its long-running battle with rivals Cadbury to trademark the shape of the KitKat bar in the UK. The court of appeal ruled that the four-finger design had “no inherent distinctiveness”.After deliberating for months, the three appeals judges delivered their judgment on Wednesday in a 16,000-word ruling that found the KitKat shape was not a “badge of origin”.“We are concerned here with ... the three-dimensional shape of a chocolate product, that has no inherent distinctiveness,” said Lord Justice Kitchin.The ruling marks the latest stage in a bitter-tasting battle between Nestlé and Mondelēz, the US owner of Cadbury, that have been battling over the KitKat trademark for seven years.Nestle’s appeal followed a UK high court ruling in January last year that blocked the trademark attempt. The European court of justice had previously found that the four-fingered shape, breaking apart with a snap, was not distinctive enough to merit a trademark and that such a designation would not comply with European law.The ruling clears the way for competitors, including the major supermarkets as well as other confectioners, to produce their own copycat KitKats without fear of legal consequences.But a Nestlé spokesperson indicated the Swiss firm was not necessarily prepared to give up, saying it was considering its next move. The company could potentially try to take the case to the UK supreme court.“Nestlé is disappointed by the court of appeal judgment and is considering its next steps,” said the spokesperson. “KitKat is much loved around the world and its four-finger shape is well known by consumers. Nestlé’s four-finger shape has been granted trademark registration in many countries of the world, for instance Germany, France, Australia, South Africa and Canada, further protecting it from imitations.”Following the appeal ruling, a Mondelēz spokesperson said: “As we have previously stated, we do not believe the shape of the KitKat bar should be protected as a trademark in the UK.”The case turned on whether a the product’s shapewas sufficiently distinctive to the brand to prevent any other manufacturer using a similar format. Protected “shape marks” are not without precedent — Toblerone, which is owned by Mondelēz, has successfully trademarked its “zigzag prism” shape.But the appeal judges found that while the four-finger shape might be “very well known” in association with KitKat, “that does not necessarily mean that the public have come to perceive the shape as a badge of origin such that they would rely upon it alone to identify the product as coming from a particular source.“They might simply regard the shape as a characteristic of products of that kind or they might find it brings to mind the product and brand name with which they have become familiar.“These kinds of recognition and association do not amount to distinctiveness for trademark purposes.”The judges also noted that the chocolate bar’s shape had not been central to its marketing in recent years: “It has nothing, therefore, to do with the informed choices that consumers make between similar products.”The judges heard that Nestlé had spent between £3m and £11m a year advertising and promoting KitKats between 1996 and 2007. More than 40m were sold in Britain in 2010.“The appeal court’s ruling indicates that shape marks are going to be increasingly difficult to obtain,” said Guy Wilmot, partner who specialises in intellectual property law at Russell-Cooke.“The court were ... concerned that if they granted the trade mark, Nestlé would have a potentially permanent monopoly on the four-finger shape, which they felt would be unfair given that KitKat had never used the shape alone to promote KitKats.”Clare Jackman, an intellectual property lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright, said the fact the two multinationals were prepared to battle through the courts for so long showed the value of what was at stake. “Trademarks are very important and valuable business assets. They confer monopoly rights, so I can see entirely why Nestlé thought, ‘our four-finger bar KitKat has been around for ages, let’s register it, because we can stop anyone from producing a bar in four fingers’”, she said.“It is typically brand owners in this space that will spend the money and push the boundaries, in trying to get as much protection as possible, because at the end of the day trademarks can potentially last forever, so it really is a signficant monopoly right.”Asked if she could foresee a challenge in supreme court, Jackman said: “I’m not going to rule it out, because I think these are two brand owners who are prepared to push this as far as it can go.”The four-fingered battle is not the only protracted legal disputes between the two confectioners. In 2004, Cadbury attempted to trademark the shade of purple it uses for its Dairy Milk bars, registering Pantone 2685C in a move that was initially successful before the court of appeal backed Nestlé challenge in 2013. An attempt last year by Cadbury to resurrect an earlier trademark on the colour was rejected by the high court.The first KitKat-type bar was sold in Britain by Rowntree in 1935, when it was called Chocolate Crisp, and the shape has changed little since then. Nestlé acquired Rowntree in 1998.A lookalike called Kvikk Lunsj, translated as “quick lunch”, launched in Norway in 1937 and is available in some UK shops.• This article was amended on 18 May 2017.

696,"The Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) in Hyderabad is set to become south India's first airport to go 100% LED-lit. With the entire Taxiway Edge Lights converted from halogen lamps to energy efficient LEDs, the authorities claimed that 75% work on the project has been completed. Of the 26,000 conventional lamps at RGIA, over 19,500 have been converted into LED."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowAccording to a report, between 2011 and 2012, sales of LED replacement globally increased by 22 per cent and the cost of a 60W equivalent LED bulb fell by nearly 40 per cent.It is believed that by 2030, LEDs will account for 75 per cent of all lighting sales around the world.RAJIV GANDHI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTThe Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) at Hyderabad will soon become 100 per cent LED-lit airport. The authorities are already done with 75 per cent work on the project.The GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd (GHIAL), which operates the airport, announced on Tuesday that it has converted the entire taxiway edge lights from halogen lamps to LEDs which are highly efficient as compared to halogen lights.LEDs also have a much smaller environmental impact than incandescent bulbs.Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) thus became south India's first and India's second airport to achieve going all LED.HYDERABAD'S CARBON NEUTRAL AIRPORTComplementing the recently achieved recognition of being carbon neutral airport, GHIAL is marching to transform the RGIA into a 100 per cent LED airport, and 75 per cent work on this has already been completed, GHIAL said in a statement.LEDs can also last more than 25 times longer than the traditional light bulbs cutting down costs further.RGIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTENANCEThe RGIA, which currently serves more than 15 million passengers per annum (MPPA) with close to 400 daily air traffic movements, has a mission to move from conventional energy to renewable energy sources for environmental sustenance. It recently commissioned a captive 5MW Solar Power Plant for its use supporting sustainable energy.UNDERGOING LED TRANSFORMATIONThe busiest and the most critical area of the airport -- the airside -- has undergone LED transformation. As many as 500 halogen lamps of taxiway edge lights were converted to LEDs.All LEDs at taxiway edge lights cover around 26 km of the area in the airside.Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport has more than 26,000 conventional lamps. More than 19,500 have been converted into LED.The switch to LED lights has amounted to a saving of 2.2 million unites of electricity per annum.""Very soon we will become 100 per cent LED-lit airport. At the same time, initiatives such as the 5MW solar power plant help us to meet a significant amount of the airport's energy requirement, using renewable means,"" said SGK Kishore, CEO, GHIAL.It does not stop here as GHIAL is also exploring the conversion of runway lights to LEDs. LED lights are close to seven times more energy efficient than the conventional incandescent lights and can even cut energy use by more than 80 per cent.However, as the technology of using LEDs on the runway is still in its early stages of development, it would take some time before the authorities can finally be done with their LED plans for the airport.

A D-day veteran who jumped 15,000ft from a plane has become the oldest person in the world to skydive – at the age of 101 and 38 days. Bryson William Verdun Hayes, known as Verdun, broke the world record on Sunday, completing a tandem skydive with three generations of his family at an airfield in Honiton, Devon. As he touched down, the former Royal Signals lance corporal said “hooray” and added that he was feeling “absolutely over the moon” at completing the challenge.The great-grandfather tried skydiving for the first time when he reached 100, but breaking the British record for the oldest skydiver was not enough for him. Hayes, who said a parachute jump was something he had wanted to do since he turned 90 – but was talked out of it by his wife, who has since died – was determined to take the world record and beat its previous holder, Canadian Armand Gendreau who skydived in June 2013 aged 101 and three days. Asked how he was feeling before Sunday’s jump, Hayes replied with a stoic “all right” and said he was looking forward to the experience. He took to the skies with 10 members of his family at Skydive Buzz in Dunkeswell, all raising money for the Royal British Legion. The youngest skydiver was Stanley, 16, Hayes’ great-grandson, while his grandson Roger, 50, son Bryan, 74, and great-granddaughter Ellie, 21, were also among those who took the leap. Ahead of the skydive, his daughter, Lin Tattersall, said: “He’s made up his own mind that he wants to do it again, and I am extremely proud of the reasoning behind it.” Hayes, from Croyde, Devon, served in the army during the second world war and was presented with a Légion d’honneur for his heroic actions in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and in Normandy, France. He was named Verdun after his father, Joseph Hayes, who served in the first world war as a sapper with the Royal Engineers and who fought during the Battle of the Somme, wrote home to his pregnant wife, Mary, from the frontline suggesting they call their child Verdun after the 1916 battle. Hayes served as a signaller and wireless operator for the Royal Signals during the second world war. He returned to Normandy in 2016 as a beneficiary of the Royal British Legion’s Remembrance Travel arm. During the war, Hayes sustained shrapnel injuries to his ribs and hands in an explosion that killed his friend, Sgt Edgar Robertson. He said: “How I came home from world war two I do not know. I was so near to the edge of everything. I lost any amount of friends in no time at all really. I just didn’t think I would ever return home.” A spokesman for the Royal British Legion said Hayes would be celebrating with a glass of champagne. He said: “We are very proud of Verdun’s achievements and his family’s support for the Royal British Legion and the money raised recognises the service and sacrifice made across all generations of the British armed forces. “The money raised will help support individuals and families from across the generations of our armed forces community.” Members of the family have separate online donation pages but Hayes, who hoped to raise £1,000, has already beaten his target and the current total on Virgin Money Giving stands at more than £1,600."

A Russian YouTuber who filmed himself playing Pokémon Go in a church has been convicted for “inciting religious hatred”.Ruslan Sokolovsky posted his video at the height of the game’s popularity in August 2016. On Thursday he was convicted by a court in Yekaterinburg and given a three-and-a-half year suspended sentence. The same offence saw two women from the Pussy Riot punk collective sent to prison for two years in 2012. Sokolovsky has been detained since October, facing up to five years in prison, and was relieved to not be facing jail time. He said: “Without the support from reporters, I would possibly have been given a real prison sentence.”Judge Yekaterina Shoponyak said Sokolovsky’s videos manifested his “disrespect for society” and that he “intended to offend religious sentiments”.The video shows Sokolovsky playing the game in the Church of All Saints in Yekaterinburg and referring to local news reports that warned people from playing it in Russia’s churches. It has since been watched more than a million times.He said: “How can one offend by entering a church with a smartphone?“I decided to just catch some Pokémon in church because, why not?“I believe it’s both safe and not prohibited by law. Let’s go.”Sokolovsky’s arrest last year was criticised on social media, where his supporters rallied under the hashtag #FreeSokolovsky. Among them was Pussy Riot, who responded to his suspended sentence on Thursday:Ruslan Sokolovsky who caught a pokemon in a church got 3.5 years of probation.not prison though - and it's already great news."

The jailing of Jakarta’s Christian governor on blasphemy charges has sparked outrage from his supporters in Indonesia, rights organisations and the EU.On Tuesday, a court in the capital of the world’s largest Muslim-majority country found Basuki Tjahaja Purnama – better known by his nickname Ahok – guilty of blasphemy, sentencing him to two years in prison.“The EU has consistently stated that laws that criminalise blasphemy when applied in a discriminatory manner can have a serious inhibiting effect on freedom of expression and on freedom of religion or belief,” the EU delegation to Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam said in a statement posted on its website. The Jakarta-based rights group the Setara Institute described the verdict as a “trial by mob”, while the British ambassador to Indonesia, Moazzam Malik, who is Muslim, tweeted a message of support.I know Ahok. Admire his wk for Jkt. Believe he isn't antiMuslim. Praying for BuVero&kids. Leaders must step up to protect tolerance&harmony. https://t.co/JcxsteEfB4At City Hall on Wednesday morning, an estimated 1,000 people wearing red and white, Indonesia’s national colours, gathered for a spontaneous choir performance in support of Ahok. Conducted by the musician Addie MS, the crowd sang the national anthem, Indonesia Raya, and Pancasila Garuda, a song about Indonesia’s founding principles of unity and diversity.When words fail, music speaks #paduansuarabalaikota #ahok #saveahok #peace #nkrihargamati #garudapancasila pic.twitter.com/CdY64EGiDNOthers registered their opposition to the verdict and sentencing by tweeting under the hashtag #RIPHukumIndonesia, which means “rest in peace Indonesian law”.The Ahok case has been watched closely as a marker of the commitment to religious tolerance and pluralism in Indonesia, where religious hardliners have been playing an increasingly prominent role in politics.In an unusual move, the panel of five judges on Tuesday dismissed the prosecutor’s recommendations to drop the initial blasphemy charges due to insufficient evidence. Prosecutors had recommended the governor instead face a sentence of two years’ probation, and one year in jail if he reoffended. But the judges – citing among others the “expert” opinion of an Islamic vigilante group leader – said they found the minority governor convincingly guilty of blasphemy, incarcerating him for two years. Ahok for months faced the wrath of hardline Islamists after he cited a Qur’anic verse on the campaign trail last September. The verse, he said, had been manipulated by some religious leaders to justify the claim the Muslims should not vote for non-Muslim leaders.Uproar over an edited version of the speech that went viral spilled into a series of angry mass rallies spearheaded by Islamists since late last year, and has catalysed the deepening of religious and ethnic divides in the capital.Some observers argue that religious hardliners may have swayed the Indonesian judiciary.International human rights organisations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said the verdict would tarnish Indonesia’s reputation for religious tolerance and pluralism, and urged the country to repeal its “unjust” blasphemy law. Ahok has indicated he will appeal against the ruling."

Thankfully I’m okay. Bike totaled. Driver kept going!”Just got rammed on purpose by an impatient driver who followed me onto the pavement! Thankfully I'm okay 🙏 Bike totaled. Driver kept going! pic.twitter.com/o7FT4iXsAoThe picture was geotagged from Beausoleil in France, close to Froome’s home in Monaco. His Pinarello Dogma F10 bike appeared to be damaged beyond repair.Team Sky said the 31-year-old had returned home to get a spare bike and had continued his training after the incident, which will be reported to the police.Last month, 2011 Giro d’Italia winner Michele Scarponi of the Astana team was killed when he was knocked off his bike by a van while training close to home in Italy. Scarponi had been preparing for this year’s Giro, where the Mortirolo climb has now been named in his honour.Also last month, Wanty-Groupe Gobert rider Yoann Offredo posted pictures on social media of himself badly bloodied, saying he had been the victim of an assault while out riding with two friends in the Chevreuse Valley, south west of Paris.Froome’s Team Sky team-mate Geraint Thomas, who is competing at the Giro d’Italia, told cyclingweekly.com: “It’s a reminder, it shows how dangerous it can be. I only saw it five minutes before getting off the bus. It didn’t look good at all. I’ll speak to him later today.”Spanish rider Mikel Landa, who is also riding at the Giro for Team Sky, added: “You can’t always be scared when you are riding on the roads, but with the situation like you see today with Froome, you think a lot about how we are at risk on the road. I had goose bumps (seeing the photograph). I thought about Scarponi. In an accident, we are always going to be the one who’s worse off.”Froome is preparing for this year’s Tour, where he will be seeking a fourth title in five years and third in a row. He finished 18th in the Tour de Romandie in Switzerland at the end of last month, and his next race is expected to be the Critérium du Dauphiné – a race he won ahead of each of his Tour victories in 2013, 2015 and 2016 – at the start of June.

Jimmy Kimmel has opened up about his newborn son’s open-heart surgery and pleaded for people to support the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in an emotional monologue on his TV show.“It was a scary story and, before I go into it, I want you to know it has a happy ending,” the late-night talk show host told the audience of Jimmy Kimmel Live.Barack Obama took to social media, retweeting Kimmel and touting the benefits of the Affordable Care Act. “Well said, Jimmy. That’s exactly why we fought so hard for the ACA, and why we need to protect it for kids like Billy. And congratulations,” he tweeted. Kimmel described how William John, nicknamed Billy, was born 10 days ago with a heart defect. The condition was discovered hours after the comedian’s wife, Molly, gave birth.He was taken by ambulance to the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles to undergo surgery. Kimmel described it as “the longest three hours of my life”.Billy was released from hospital six days after the surgery and was “doing great”, Kimmel said. He showed photos of him with his wife, their daughter Jane, two, and Billy.The infant will have another open-heart operation within six months to repair the valve openings followed by a third procedure when he is a teenager.The host then delivered an impassioned speech on how every American family should be able to receive life-saving healthcare. “No parent should ever have to decide if they can afford to save their child’s life,” Kimmel told viewers. He criticised President Donald Trump’s proposed cuts to the National Institutes of Health and praised Congress for instead calling for increased funding.“If your baby is going to die and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make … Whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?” he said.Kimmel said he would skip the rest of this week’s shows to be with his family."

761,"Martin Sorrell, CEO of world's largest advertising and public relations company WPP, was awarded a payout of over $62 million (?400 crore) in 2016. The payout was around 32% less from the $91 million (?585 crore) he received in 2015, one of the biggest in UK's corporate history. With this, Sorrell has received $272 million in total remuneration since 2012.","UK’s best-paid chief executive has now received about £210m in total remuneration from WPP since 2012Sir Martin Sorrell received £48m in remuneration last year as WPP, the marketing and advertising company he founded and runs, moved to curb the level of his future payouts to avoid further clashes with investors.Sorrell, who has been on the receiving end of a string of shareholder voting revolts at WPP’s annual meetings in recent years, received total pay, bonuses and incentive scheme payouts of £48.1m in 2016.The figure is 31.6% lower than the £70.4m he received in 2015, one of the biggest pay deals in UK corporate history, which was opposed by one-third of WPP shareholders at last year’s AGM. The payout, the last to be awarded under WPP’s controversial “Leap” scheme, means Sorrell has received about £210m in total remuneration since 2012.WPP has introduced a less generous arrangement for Sorrell, which is expected to pay out £19m a year. It will be the subject of a binding vote at the company’s annual meeting in June.However, WPP said on Friday that it intended to tighten the policy further with a potential payout band of £14.9m to £19.2m maximum this year. From 2018, that will fall to between £18m and £13m as dividend equivalent payments are scrapped.The company has moved to stem further potential run-ins with investors at a time of renewed scrutiny of corporate Britain since the Brexit vote and the warning from Theresa May that she would curb boardroom excess. WPP’s chairman, Robert Quarta, appointed at last year’s annual meeting, also said planning to identify the successor to Sorrell, 72, had intensified.“Our succession planning process, which has always been rigorous, has become even more focused and detailed over the past year,” said Quarta, in WPP’s annual report published on Friday. “Whether it happens in the near or distant future, when Sir Martin leaves his role as chief executive, we will have an exceptional team of potential candidates on the bench.”Sorrell shows no signs of slowing down, having celebrated the birth of another child on the day of the US presidential election last year. He has no plans to step aside and said, on the question of succession, that there is “nothing to see here”. His pay has been a flashpoint in the past. In 2012, during what became known as the shareholder spring, nearly 60% of investors rejected his annual package for the previous year. Last year, Sorrell defended his remuneration, arguing that he had put three decades of his life into turning WPP from a maker of wire baskets into a global marketing business worth £22bn.“I’m not a Johnny-come-lately who picked a company up and turned it round [for a big payday],” he said. “If it was one five-year plan and we buggered off, fine [to criticise my pay]. Over those 31 years … I have taken a significant degree of risk. [WPP] is where my wealth is. It is long effort over a long period of time.”The question of a successor has exercised investors in recent years, with Guy Jubb, the former head of governance at Standard Life Investments, using his final appearance at a WPP annual meeting in 2015 to criticise the apparent “Sorrellcentricity” at the company.Quarta, writing in the annual report, said there is a list of internal and external candidates who could take over.“As part of our continuous assessment of those individuals who might one day become chief executive of the group, we have invited a number of leaders within WPP companies to present to the board and attend board meetings,” he said. “This exercise gives me greater confidence than ever in the strength of our people and their potential to succeed at the very top.“This internal pool is, of course, maintained alongside a constantly refined list of external candidates.”Quarta said internal candidates include those who report directly to Sorrell, as well as “many who currently occupy the senior tier below”."

His publicist told Variety that the cause of death was “cancer complications”.The Silence of the Lambs, the horror-thriller adapted from Thomas Harris’ novel, was the high point of his career as a mainstream film-maker: the film won five Oscars, including best director for Demme, and made its central character, Hannibal Lecter, into a household name.However, it was untypical of Demme’s career, both before and after its 1991 release. Having spent much of the 1960s living in London and working as a music writer, Demme cut his teeth in the no-budget school of Roger Corman: initially as a writer, then gaining his first directorial credit on the prison flick Caged Heat in 1974. (Its tag line: “Women’s prison USA – Rape Riot and Revenge! White Hot Desires melting cold prison steel!)After directing two other films for Corman, Demme found a niche in the burgeoning independent cinema scene with his 1980 film Melvin and Howard, a comedy about a former milkman who claims to be the heir of Howard Hughes. Later in the same decade, Demme completed the yuppie-in-peril comedy Something Wild, which gave Melanie Griffith one of her early successful roles.The Silence of the Lambs, he said later, “was a great delirious shock to everybody concerned”, but he appeared to being disquieted by the controversies that accompanied it, and subsequently concentrated on films that reflected his own politically liberal credentials. Philadelphia, which starred Tom Hanks in an Oscar-winning performance and brought Aids and gay characters into the mainstream. Meanwhile, Beloved, released in 1998, was an adaptation of Toni Morrison’s seminal novel about slavery.Alongside his feature film career, Demme indulged a taste for the odd, the eccentric and the underground. He made documentaries about Talking Heads (including Stop Making Sense, 1984), Neil Young (among them Heart of Gold, 2006) and his radical priest cousin (Cousin Bobby, 1992); he filmed Spalding Gray’s celebrated one-man show Swimming to Cambodia (1987), and shot a profile of US president Jimmy Carter (Man from Plains, 2007).His mainstream film-making took a dip in the 2000s, after the poorly received remake of Charade, The Truth About Charlie and a new version of The Manchurian Candidate, but he restored his reputation with the wedding comedy-drama Rachel Getting Married and the likable girl-rocker film Ricki and the Flash.Jodie Foster, who won an Oscar for her role in The Silence of the Lambs, released a statement earlier today. “I am heart-broken to lose a friend, a mentor, a guy so singular and dynamic you’d have to design a hurricane to contain him,” it read. “Jonathan was as quirky as his comedies and as deep as his dramas. He was pure energy, the unstoppable cheerleader for anyone creative. Just as passionate about music as he was about art, he was and will always be a champion of the soul. JD, most beloved, something wild, brother of love, director of the lambs. Love that guy. Love him so much.” Meryl Streep, who took the title role in Ricki and the Flash, also released a statement to pay tribute to “A big hearted, big tent, compassionate man”, while Tom Hanks called him “the grandest of men”.Very sad to hear of the passing of the great Jonathan Demme. Admired his movies, his documentaries, his concert films. He could do anything.Film-makers such as Edgar Wright and James Wan have also paid tribute to Demme on Twitter, with Wright saying: “Admired his movies, his documentaries, his concert films. He could do anything.”"

The luxury shoe and bag retailer Jimmy Choo has put itself up for sale in a move that took the market by surprise.The retailer said it had “decided to conduct a review of the various strategic options open to the company to maximise value for its shareholders” and that it was seeking offers for the business.The move was backed by the company’s independent directors and JAB Luxury, its majority shareholder with a stake of 68%.Shares in Jimmy Choo jumped 10% to a record high of 186.25p on the news, valuing the group at more than £720m. The company floated on the stock market in 2014 at a price of 140p a share, valuing it at about £550m.Any sale is expected to attract interest from strategic American buyers as well as Middle Eastern, Chinese and Russian bidders.The company was founded in London in 1996 by the Malaysian fashion designer Jimmy Choo and the then Vogue accessories editor Tamara Mellon. It runs 150 stores around the world, opening 10 last year as well as refitting 16 shops.It recently reported operating profits of £42.5m for 2016, up nearly 43%, after success with luxury trainers. Men’s shoes remain its fastest-growing category and account for 9% of revenue.The company has benefited from the drop in sterling since the EU referendum and is expanding in China. It has fared better than other luxury retailers such as Burberry, which were hit by Chinese tourists cutting back on luxury purchases.JAB, an investment company owned by Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, wants to sell its stake in the shoes group to focus on food and other consumer goods. The family, one of Europe’s wealthiest business dynasties, has been building an empire of coffee brands and last year added Krispy Kreme Doughnuts to its portfolio. It also owns the US cosmetics brand Coty. Luxury investments make up less than 10% of JAB’s portfolio, and it plans to use the sale proceeds to take on the likes of Nestlé.A Euromonitor analyst said: “Globally, retail sales of men’s designer footwear have grown marginally faster than women’s designer footwear over the last three years. So it is easy to see why Jimmy Choo has expanded into this male segment. Women’s luxury footwear still generates almost twice the retail value of men’s luxury footwear, though, and that disparity is unlikely to narrow significantly over the next decade.“But Jimmy Choo needs to be careful not to get ahead of itself. Remember what happened to Mulberry, another niche British luxury brand, when it drifted too far from its comfort zone? One year sales were soaring, the next they were dropping amidst a spate of profit warnings.”"

The former world number one posted a picture of herself in a swimsuit, showing her baby bump, with the caption '20 weeks' before deleting it within minutes. The 35-year-old has been engaged to Reddit Co-founder Alexis Ohanian.","Serena Williams is pregnant with her first child, her spokesperson has confirmed.The tennis star hinted at the good news when she posted a photo of herself on Snapchat wearing a swimsuit and revealing what appeared to be a large baby bump with the caption “20 weeks” on Wednesday. The snap was deleted less than a half hour later.However, Williams’ team confirmed the implications of the photo later in the day. “I’m happy to confirm Serena is expecting a baby this fall,” a spokesperson for Williams told the Guardian by email.The Women’s Tennis Association, which listed Williams as scheduled to enter next month’s Madrid Open as recently as Monday, said they had yet to be contacted by anyone from the American’s team regarding her status.“We have not been informed, nor do we have confirmation,” a tour spokesperson told the Guardian. “We will let you know once we have further information.”Serena's snap suggests that she won the Australian Open without dropping a set while pregnant. pic.twitter.com/ltPndJRJBqWilliams, 35, announced she was engaged to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in December. The announcement left the sport’s chattering class wondering to what degree she was looking ahead to life after tennis.She answered that speculation with brio at the Australian Open, capturing her 23rd major singles title without dropping a set, to eclipse Steffi Graf’s record for grand slam titles in the Open era and regain the No1 ranking she had ceded in the fall to Germany’s Angelique Kerber.But she has been inactive since her win over elder sister Venus in the final at Melbourne Park. Last month, Williams pulled out of Indian Wells and Miami, citing a left knee injury. That enabled Kerber to retake the top ranking, though Serena is assured a return to No1 in next week’s table when the points from last year’s Porsche Grand Prix drop off.The announcement comes one week after Victoria Azarenka, the former world No1 and two-time grand slam champion, announced she will return to the tour after 14-month layoff that included the birth of her son, Leo, in December.Williams’ win at Melbourne Park made her the oldest player to win a major singles championship in the Open era, breaking a record she set herself last year – and again the year before that. She has won grand slam titles in her teens (one), 20s (12) and 30s (10, more than triple the previous mark). No one could think less of Williams, now closer to 40 than 30, if she called it a career.But there’s equal if not more reason to believe Williams has unfinished business.She remains tantalizingly close to the all-time grand slam record held by Australia’s Margaret Court, whose 24 major titles were split between the amateur and professional eras. She still plays at an extraordinary high level, having won 125 of her 138 singles matches since Wimbledon 2014. And while there are no shortage of young lions on the tour, among them Garbiñe Muguruza, Karolína Plíšková and Madison Keys, none has offered a sustained challenge of Williams’ dominance the way Monica Seles swiftly ended Graf’s stranglehold on the sport.Nor would Williams be the first mother to excel on the tour.Kim Clijsters was already a borderline Hall of Famer when she retired abruptly at 23, having won the 2005 US Open and spent 19 weeks atop the women’s rankings. But the Belgian was even better after a 28-month layoff that included the birth of her daughter, winning once more at Flushing Meadows as an unseeded wild card in only her third tournament back. That made her the first mother to win a major singles title since Evonne Goolagong Cawley at Wimbledon in 1980, setting the stage for a final act that included two more grand slam titles and a return to the No1 ranking."

They usually get that power from conventional rechargeable batteries.Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology in the US and Chongqing University in China wanted to see if they could untether small energy needs from the wall socket by harvesting energy from a users body movements.They have been working on this approach in recent years, creating triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) that can harness the mechanical energy all around us, such as that created by our footsteps, and then use it to power portable electronics.However, most TENG devices take several hours to charge small electronics, such as a sensor, and they are made of acrylic, which is heavy.Researchers turned to an ultra-light, rhombic paper-cut design a few inches long and covered it with different materials to turn it into a power unit.The four outer sides, made of gold- and graphite-coated sand paper, comprised the devices energy-storing supercapacitor element.The inner surfaces, made of paper and coated in gold and a fluorinated ethylene propylene film, comprised the TENG energy harvester.Pressing and releasing it over just a few minutes charged the device to 1 volt, which was enough to power a remote control, temperature sensor or a watch, researchers said.The research was published in the journal ACS Nano.

Shahid reportedly said if the magazine team didn't want to make the change, he wanted the entire story removed. The team made the change but later altered the title following the release of 'Rangoon'."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowIs Shahid Kapoor a star or a superstar? The answer to that depends on whether you are a 'Shanatic' or not. Well, Shahid himself thought he was a superstar but unfortunately, the editor of a popular film magazine had to disagree.According to Rajeev Masand's latest column in Open Magazine, it all began when Shahid Kapoor did a photoshoot for the cover of a 'popular film glossy' a few days before the release of his film Rangoon. The issue was supposed to hit the stands a couple of weeks after the film's release.When the magazine's team sent Shahid a scan of the feature story, before the issue was sent to the press for printing, Shahid apparently 'balked', according to the magazine's editor. Shahid, reportedly, did not like being called a 'star' in the story's headline and demanded that 'star' should be changed to 'superstar'. Shahid said that if the magazine team did not want to make the change, he wanted the entire story 'pulled'.Consequently, the magazine team made the required change and the edition was sent to the press for printing.But Rangoon finally released and flopped big time. The magazine's editor reportedly 'felt silly for indulging the actor's whims' and immediately ensured that the issue was called back in time so that the headline could be changed again. So, the new headline focused on Shahid Kapoor recently becoming a father.A little googling will let you know which film magazine is being talked about. We wonder what Shahid Kapoor has to say about this.ALSO READ: RANGOON MOVIE REVIEWWATCH: Media troubles my wife but she can handle it well Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

A team of researchers at an Israeli university has successfully tested a technology using fluorescent bacteria and lasers that could become a safer system for detecting buried landmines.An estimated 100m landmines are scattered in some 70 countries, a legacy of often long-past conflict, and the devices injure up to 20,000 people a year. Mine clearance work is typically dangerous, labour-intensive and costly.The team at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University has tested mine detection using bacteria genetically modified to give off a fluorescent signal when mines – often made out plastic – are close, which can then be detected with a laser.Reporting the findings in the journal Nature Biotechnology, the researchers say their approach relies on tiny amounts of vapour given off by the explosives in the mines.It was recognised that some plants reacted to those vapours, and the research used modified bacteria that essentially glow in contact with the explosive vapour. Encased in polymer beads scattered on the suspected minefield, that fluorescence is then detected by a laser system that researchers suggest could be mounted on a vehicle – including drones.The system has been successfully tested in a field of real landmines, scanning the ground at a rate of around 18cm per second – a speed the researchers hope to increase.Belkin’s team is not the first to develop bacteria that glow in the presence of explosive vapour – similar findings were reported by a team at Edinburgh University in 2009 – but it appears to be the first to have developed a potentially functioning detection system using the technology.“Our field data show that engineered biosensors may be useful in a landmine detection system,” said Prof Shimshon Belkin, who headed the experiment. However, the technology would need to be developed further still, he added.“For this to be possible, several challenges need to be overcome, such as enhancing the sensitivity and stability of the sensor bacteria, improving scanning speeds to cover large areas, and making the scanning apparatus more compact so it can be used on board a light unmanned aircraft or drone.”The university said in a statement: “This appears to be the first demonstration of a functional standoff landmine detection system.” A byproduct of the research by Belkin and his team was announced three years ago: the use of modified bacteria to detect pollutants in water, suggesting further applications for the technology.

820,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched BHIM-Aadhaar platform, the merchant interface of the BHIM App, that will allow people to make payments through the fingerprint scanner. The service will use Aadhaar numbers linked to bank accounts, and payments will be finalised only after customers keep their finger on the merchant's biometric machine connected to the app through a smartphone."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched BHIM-Aadhar pay app, that will allow people to make payments without using a smartphone. Instead, the app will enable payments through the fingerprint scanner, by authenticating the biometric details of a user with Aadhaar database. The app, which will be available for download to merchants across the country, will link your Aadhaar number and biometric fingerprint to complete a transaction. This will not only make cashless payment more prevalent but also possibly more easy and hassle-free. To enable the transactions through BHIM-Aadhar, merchants will have to purchase fingerprint scanners.With the implementation of the new system, all you will need is your fingerprint to make a payment. Using the Aadhaar number linked to your bank account, the payment for your purchase will be requested by the merchant but is finalised only when you keep your finger on the biometric machine connected to the app through the smartphone.The app is available on both Android and iOS. But the merchants will need to keep a biometric sensor connected to the phone for authentication; apart from signing in to the app after a KYC. PM Modi has also announced incentives for merchants deploying this new system. To start with there will be no extra charges levied on the payment, as with other digital payment modes like Debit card, Credit card or e-wallets. Then, the Merchants Discount Rate or MDR that is paid to the bank by the merchant will also be waived off.           The BHIM-Aadhaar pay app is developed only for merchants and makes use of two major platforms developed by the government -- Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) for authentication and Aadhaar Payment Bridge (APB) that acts as a repository. Niti Aayog says this makes the Aadhaar Pay payment system highly secure.If multiple accounts are linked to your Aadhaar card, it may also give you an option to select which account you need to use to make the payment. So probably the app first authenticates the customer using two unique credentials - the Aadhaar ID and his fingerprint sensor and then gives out an option to select the payment bank, something similar to what the BHIM app does.

835,"Tamil Nadu farmers on Monday ran naked near PM Narendra Modi's office, demanding ?39,000 crore drought relief fund from the Centre. Reportedly, this comes after they were promised an appointment with Modi but were not allowed to meet him later. These farmers have been sitting on protest since almost a month, holding skulls in hands and live mice in mouths. "," Jump to navigationSpeak NowFarmers from Tamil Nadu ran naked near the Prime Minister's office today, to protest against lack of government assistance in their fight for a drought relief package for a state.The farmers, who have been protesting at Jantar Mantar for 28 days, wanted to drop off their memorandum at the Prime Minister's Office.According to an Indian Express report, a delegation of seven farmers were taken to the PMO and were told that they would meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.When they reached there, they found PM Modi was unavailable. So they had to hand over their memorandum to a PMO official instead.Delhi: Tamil Nadu farmers stage nude protest outside North Block, demand drought relief fund#ITVideo https://t.co/NounxnP7mg pic.twitter.com/vC7SpvwlO1Two other protestors joined him and started running naked in South Block. At one point, the farmers even started rolling on the street naked.The farmer who led the naked protest was eventually arrested.Here's why these farmers are protesting:1. Last year, Tamil Nadu recorded the worst spell of northeast monsoon in 140 years, leading to most farmers losing their winter crop. Most of these farmers had lost their summer crop too, due to Tamil Nadu's tussle with Kanataka over sharing water from the Cauvery river.The timing of government's demonetisation move didn't help either, as the prevailing cash crunch prevented farmers from tackling their farming expenses. Most of them couldn't even prepare for the next sowing season.2. The shock over crop loss and lack of revenue led to some farmers getting heart attacks, while many others committed suicide. At one point, an estimated 106 farmer deaths were reported within a month in Tamil Nadu. Some reports also say 144 farmers committed suicide between October to December in 2016.For the remaining farmers, loan installments and dues to moneylenders have now become the greatest problem. Most farmers haven't earned anything to come through on these payments. Farmers who tried selling their land, couldn't even find buyers because it was that dry.3. With no option left, a contingent of these farmers from Thanjavur and Tiruchirappalli came to Delhi and have been protesting at Jantar Mantar since March 14.These farmers seek a drought relief fund of Rs 40,000 crore, better support for their produce and a loan waiver for peasants in Tamil Nadu. One Tamil Nadu local told Firstpost that the farmers asked for a compensation of Rs 25,000 per acre, but they were only paid Rs 5,465 per acre.4. Despite the attention their protests have received, the farmers still await a meeting with the government's top officials. To garner attention, these farmers have resorted to all kinds of methods like cutting themselves and holding dead rats and snakes in their mouth.Late in March some farmers even wore skulls of dead Tamil Nadu farmers, symbolising the fate that awaits them if the centre does not help.Two farmers even attempted suicide at Jantar Mantar.5. The farmers say they want to meet Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh for a loan waiver and a special package. They plan to sit on an indefinite hunger strike and not leave Delhi unless their demands met. Some of the farmers have even threatened to commit mass suicide.Exactly a month ago, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh had, in Rajya Sabha, promised 'substantial financial assistance' to the farmers.

849,"A prematurely-born girl child, who was declared dead by a male nurse at a hospital in Rajasthan, 'came back to life' on Tuesday at a crematorium where her body was taken for last rites.

When she took the infant to the burial ground, the baby girl started crying. In Rajasthan's Bundi district, a shocking incident shed some light on the sad state of affairs of the health department.A woman had to give birth in the absence of a doctor in a government hospital in Bundi, and the male nurse who assisted her during the delivery told her that her child was dead and should be taken to the burial ground.All this happened in the absence of a doctor.Following the male nurse's advice, the family took the new born for the burial. But few minutes before the burial the child started crying and that's when everyone realised that the baby girl is still alive.They again went to the hospital and complained against the male nurse who misguided them. When the deputy superintendent saw a ruckus, he went on to defend the nurse and said that since the child is born weak, there are hardly any chances of survival. He in fact did not even try saving the newborn's life.Residents of Bundi district are appalled by this incident of negligence and questioned the hospital authorities that if the infant had not cried before the burial then because of the wrong information given to them, the family would have buried her alive. Not only that, deliveries being done in the absence of doctors raises many questions about the functioning of the hospital.Deputy controller Dr OP Verma defended his staff and said that the baby girl was born premature and since there was no movement at the time of birth, she was declared dead.However, the family members believe that if immediately after delivery the infant would have been shifted to the ICU then her health would not have deteriorated.Also read: Liquor ban: Rajasthan denotifies highways within city limits Also read: SC order affects 2,800 liquor shops in Rajasthan Also watch:  Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

He said he has come amongst the people of Mainpuri to express his grief. He asserted that he will contest the next election in 2019 from Mainpuri as well.Aiming at BJP, he said they made the maximum laws in their tenure so far just to draw the attention of the people from the plight of the common man and farmers.He said he was not informed of the coalition between SP and Congress and when he was informed, he opposed it but Akhilesh did not pay heed to his objections. The defeat in Assembly elections was a result of that.

Although the print and paper quality of the seized counterfeits was poor, they resembled genuine notes.The officials said the change of security features of currency notes in every 3-4 years will lead to curbing of counterfeiting to a great extent.Those who were arrested recently along with fake notes with face value of Rs 2,000 have told investigators that the notes were printed in Pakistan with the help of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and had been smuggled into the country through Bangladesh, the officials claimed.A study conducted by the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, in 2016 pegged the value of fake Indian currency notes in circulation at Rs 400 crore.ALSO READ | Fake Rs 2,000 notes return to haunt; SBI ATM dispenses counterfeit currency in UP's Shahjahanpur  ALSO READ | Fake notes back after demonetisation; Malda emerges as epicentre  ALSO WATCH | The Mahatma goes missing from Rs 2000 note in Madhya Pradesh   Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

Cristiano Ronaldo now has an international airport named after him. The Real Madrid striker was joined on Wednesday by dozens of guests and hundreds of fans in his native Madeira Islands for an official ceremony renaming the local airport as Aeroporto Cristiano Ronaldo.Portugal’s president and the prime minister flew to the island and unveiled a commemorative plaque outside the terminal entrance, above a bust of Ronaldo.The 32-year-old Ronaldo is a local hero in Madeira, where he is seen as a rags-to-riches success. He already has a statue, a museum and a hotel named after him in Madeira. “You know how proud I am of my roots, my homeland,” Ronaldo, wearing a dark suit and tie, said in a speech.The four-time player of the year has made a record 138 national team appearances for Portugal and is the team’s top scorer with 71 goals.The change was decided by the Madeira regional government after Portugal won the 2016 European Championship. Critics said a more distinguished historical figure would be more appropriate. Petitions were started for and against the change.Ronaldo acknowledged that it was rare for a public figure to be honoured while still alive, saying he was aware that some people didn’t agree with the name change. However, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said the tribute was legitimate because it was decided by an elected government.Ronaldo, Rebelo de Sousa said in his speech, is “an example of excellence” and “projects Madeira and Portugal across the world far more than anybody else.”Ronaldo is not the first football player with his name on an airport. In Northern Ireland, an airport was renamed George Best Belfast City Airport in 2006, a year after the local player and former Manchester United winger died.In Funchal, the regional government provided transport to the outdoor ceremony for schoolchildren and elderly people at care homes. Also present were players and officials from the local Andorinha soccer club, where Ronaldo started when he was seven years old.Tourism is the economic mainstay of Madeira, which lies about 500km (310 miles) off the north-west coast of Africa. About 2.5 million passengers use the airport annually. The terminal is a low, two-story building next to an oceanside runway where landings are famous for sometimes being hairy because of crosswinds."

868,"German water expert Martin Riese works as a water sommelier and is paid to taste water for Patina Restaurant Group in California. Riese, who has been drinking water professionally since 2005, is known to be the only certified 'Water Sommelier' in America. He also organises water tastings and classes to teach people how to identify different kinds of water."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowYou might think you have a high-paying and relaxing job, but what you do for a living is nothing compared to what Martin Riese does.He tastes different kinds of bottled water, and gets paid s**tloads of money for it!Yes, you read that right. Riese is a German water expert, and believes that water should be treated the same way as wine. What does that mean? Well, if we can go around tasting varieties of wine, measuring and comparing the depth of their flavour, then why can't we do the same thing with bottled water?So, instead of a wine sommelier (a steward or expert trained in wine services), Riese is actually a water sommelier. What makes his taste buds tingle is nothing less than H2O, which might come in differently-shaped bottles, and look clear and pure, but it's actually nothing of the kind.Not many people know that bottled water or mineral water is actually graded according to their TDS level. TDS stands for Total Dissolved Solids, or the mineral count in the water we drink. What this essentially means is that there is no bottled water that is pure (though it might look like it). In this day and age, water is treated, has differing mineral counts, and therefore different tastes. A water sommelier is just trained to identify these differences.Also read: Someone deep fried water successfully, just so you could have water pakoras All you need to be good at this job is an unquenchable thirst for water. Riese is the only one who holds the title of water sommelier in the USA, where he moved from Germany in 2012. Apparently, water sommeliers are quite common in Europe, and all of them advocate water as the most precious drink in the world (now you just can't disagree with that!).Water has body, and depth--we all know this every time we drink some of it. But if the water sommeliers like Riese are to be believed, it has a lot to do with smell and sight as well as taste. Given the rising water crises we face globally, and our increasing dependence on packaged water, developing this sort of a flavour profile might just be the way to go for the future. And experts like Riese are actually doing their part in this venture.Riese now works with the Patina Restaurant Group in Los Angeles, California, where he serves bottled water to discerning customers, organises water tastings, and participates in international competitions. What's the best perk he gets from his unique job? He's always hydrated (which means he must have really good skin, hair, and kidney functions, to say the least). And trust us, that's just the kind of job that keeps one healthy and happy.Watch this short film made on Martin Riese's work, here:The Water Sommelier from MEL Films on Vimeo.

875,"A Private Member's Bill has been tabled in the Rajya Sabha which seeks to ensure that the Parliament meets for at least 100 days every year. The bill, submitted by Shiromani Akali Dal MP Naresh Gujral, also calls for special sessions for fifteen days to discuss two issues of utmost public importance. Currently, the Parliament meets for 70-80 days annually."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowAt a time when public cynicism about the country's parliamentarians is at an all time high, there is one MP, who believes that the members of Parliament need to work much harder.He is Naresh Gujral, the Akali Dal MP in the Rajya Sabha. Gujral believes that Parliament needs to meet more often than it does now.Gujral has tabled a private member's Bill, the Parliament Enhancement of Productivity Bill, asking for Parliament to must meet at least for 100 days a year.The Bill could not have come at a more opportune moment. Adjournments are fast becoming a norm rather than an aberration. Complete sessions have been washed out without transacting any business inside the Houses and outside a Shiv Sena MP has made the news for beating up an Air India official.Gujral's Bill, if adopted by the government, could go some distance in not only making Parliament a lot more productive but it will also help redeem the MPs in the eye of the public.WHY THE BILL IS SIGNIFICANTIn addition to making it mandatory for Parliament to sit at least for a hundred days a year, spread over four sessions, it also calls for the convening of a special session of both houses for fifteen days.The special session as envisaged by Gujral will not have either the question hour or the zero hour but will be devoted exclusively to taking up two issues of utmost public importance.It has a provision for each political party submitting at least two issues before the business advisory committee that it wants to be taken up in the special session.Significantly at a time when both Houses of Parliament are routinely adjourned or unable to transact any business on account of disruptions. The bill has a provision for compensating the hours lost due to disruptions by adding it to the number of hours that the Houses must sit to make up for the disruptions.Gujral's Bill is silent on the need to deprive the MP's of their allowances on the days that the house is adjourned due to disruptions.WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE YEARSIn the years after its inception in 1952, Parliament used to meet for 100-120 days a year. Sadly, over the years there has been a steady decline in the number of days that Parliament meets. The number of days it meets now is down to 70-80.The government must adopt the Bill and ensure its passage for it to become law. The jury is still out on whether this Bill will be able to muster up the majority support in both Houses of Parliament, but Gujral's Bill is certainly an idea whose time has come.

883,"Scientists have developed a test that can predict the age at which a person could develop Alzheimer's. The test calculates the risk of onset of disease based on genetic markers developed from data of over 70,000 individuals having Alzheimer's and otherwise. Researchers said that while genetics can influence the risk of dementia, a healthy lifestyle can also curb the risk.","Test based on 31 genetic markers could be used to calculate any individual’s yearly risk for onset of diseaseScientists have developed a new genetic test for Alzheimer’s risk that can be used to predict the age at which a person will develop the disease.A high score on the test, which is based on 31 genetic markers, can translate to being diagnosed many years earlier than those with a low-risk genetic profile, the study found. Those ranked in the top 10% in terms of risk were more than three times as likely to develop Alzheimer’s during the course of the study, and did so more than a decade before those who ranked in the lowest 10%.Rahul Desikan, of the University of California – who led the international effort, said the test could be used to calculate any individual’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s that year.“That is, if you don’t already have dementia, what is your yearly risk for AD onset, based on your age and genetic information,” he said.The so-called polygenic hazard score test was developed using genetic data from more than 70,000 individuals, including patients with Alzheimer’s disease and healthy elderly people.It is already known that genetics plays a powerful role in Alzheimer’s. Around a quarter of patients have a strong family history of the disease, and scientists have shown this is partly explained by a gene called ApoE, which comes in three versions, and is known to have a powerful influence on the risk of getting the most common late-onset type of Alzheimer’s. One version of ApoE appears to reduce risk by up to 40%, while those with two copies (one from each parent) of the high-risk version can increase risk by 12 times.The latest study takes a new approach, showing that, aside from ApoE, there are thousands of background genetic variations that each have a tiny influence on Alzheimer’s risk, but whose cumulative influence is substantial.The researchers first identified nearly 2,000 single letter differences in the genetic code (known as SNPs) and, after ranking them for influence, developed a test based on 31 of the markers. The test was then used to accurately predict an individual’s risk of getting the disease in an independent patient cohort.In people with the high-risk version of ApoE, those ranked in the top 10% of risk on the new test got Alzheimer’s at an average age of 84 years, compared with 95 years for those ranked in the lowest 10%.James Pickett, head of research at Alzheimer’s Society, said: “Preventing the development of dementia symptoms is the holy grail of Alzheimer’s research but to succeed we first need accurate methods to predict who is most likely to develop the condition. This study’s approach was fairly successful at predicting the likelihood of someone developing dementia over the coming year, but needs to be tested further in mixed, non-US populations.” Pickett added that, while the score could help to identify people for trials, it was too early to apply it as a genetic testing tool for use in the clinic.Rosa Sancho, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said that while genetic makeup can influence the chances of developing dementia, a healthy diet, regular physical activity and remaining mentally active can also drive down the risk. “Genetics is only part of the story and we know that lifestyle factors also influence our risk of developing Alzheimer’s,” she said. “The best current evidence points to habits we can all adopt to help lower our risk and indicates that what’s good for your heart is also good for the brain.”The findings are published in the journal PLOS Medicine."

There were other batsmen who needed the batting practice much more than the senior pro.Many were sitting close to the boundary ropes while many were trying to catch a glimpse of action from the boundary wall adjacent to the main road.Finally, one of Dhoni's many fans jumped over the wall from outside the ground and rushed to the captain while he was at the crease.With a paper in his hand, the boy sought Dhoni's autograph and the Jharkhand skipper obliged him. The fan, ecstatic at his achievement, couldn't stop himself from touching the legendary Indian skipper's feet before he was escorted out of the field of play. It seemed like a matter of great pride for the fan as he walked out with his both arms up in the air.For the rest of the crowd, Dhoni obliged them by finishing the match with his trademark six over long-on fence to take his team into the semis with six wickets in hand.

899,"Employers may bar staff from wearing visible religious symbols, including women wearing Islamic headscarves at work, European Court of Justice ruled on Tuesday. However, customers cannot demand that workers remove headscarves if the company has no policy barring religious symbols, it stated. Notably, this is the EU court's first decision on the issue of women wearing Islamic headscarves at work.","European court of justice says garments can be banned as part of general policy covering religious and political symbols Share your views on the ruling

Politicians on the right have welcomed a ruling by the EU’s highest court that allows companies to ban staff from wearing visible religious symbols, as a long-awaited legal judgment ricocheted into the French and Dutch election campaigns.In its first decision on the issue of women wearing Islamic headscarves at work, the European court of justice in Luxembourg ruled the garments could be banned, but only as part of a general policy barring all religious and political symbols.Nor can customers simply demand workers remove headscarves if the company has no policy barring religious symbols, the court ruled on Tuesday.The long-awaited ruling came on the eve of Dutch elections, where Muslim immigration has been a contentious issue. In France, where the race to succeed President François Hollande remains wide open, politicians on the right seized on the issue.François Fillon, the presidential candidate who has taken a hardline stance on Islam’s place in France, welcomed the judgment. On the day he was placed under formal investigation for misuse of public funds he said in a statement that it was “an immense relief, not just for thousands of companies but also for their workers”. He said the ruling would be “a factor in cohesion and social peace”, particularly in France.Gilbert Collard, an MP for the Rassemblement Bleu Marine, which supports Marine Le Pen’s Front National, claimed the ruling was an endorsement. “Even the ECJ votes Marine,” he wrote on Twitter.In Germany, the rightwing populist party, Alternative für Deutschland, also welcomed the ruling: “The ECJ’s ruling sends out the right signal, especially for Germany,” said the AfD’s Berlin leader, Georg Pazderski. “Of course companies have to be allowed to ban the wearing of headscarves.”The ECJ issued a joint judgment in the cases of two women, from France and Belgium, who were dismissed for refusing to remove headscarves.“An internal rule of an undertaking which prohibits the visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination,” the court said.It ruled that a company’s wish to project a neutral image was legitimate and allowed internal rules banning political, philosophical or religious symbols.The first case was referred to the ECJ by the Belgian courts. Samira Achbita had been a receptionist for the Belgian branch of G4S, the London-listed outsourcing and security company when, after three years at the firm she decided she wanted to start wearing a headscarf at work for religious reasons. Achbita was fired in June 2006 for refusing to take off her scarf. The company said she had broken unwritten rules prohibiting religious symbols.In the second case, Asma Bougnaoui, a design engineer, was fired from an IT consultancy firm, Micropole, after a customer complained that his staff had been “embarrassed” by her headscarf while she was on their premises to give advice. She had been told before taking the job that wearing a headscarf might pose problems for the company’s customers.In Achbita’s case the ECJ followed the advice of a senior legal adviser to the court, who argued that companies should be allowed to have policies banning the wearing of religious and political symbols.“The court of justice finds that G4S’s internal rule refers to the wearing of visible signs of political, philosophical or religious beliefs and therefore covers any manifestation of such beliefs without distinction. The rule thus treats all employees to the undertaking in the same way, notably by requiring them, generally and without any differentiation, to dress neutrally.”In Bougnaoui’s case the court’s adviser had ruled that she had suffered discrimination. She had been “professionally competent” and sacked only because she had refused to remove her headscarf, the advocate general advised.The court upheld this view with a less ringing endorsement. It said customers’ wishes not to be served by a worker wearing a headscarf did not give companies a get-out clause from EU anti-discrimination law. “However, in the absence of such a rule, the willingness of an employer to take account of the wishes of a customer no longer to have the employer’s services provided by a worker wearing an Islamic headscarf cannot be considered an occupational requirement that could rule out discrimination.”The ECJ did not rule on whether Bougnaoui’s dismissal was based on her failure to observe company policies, saying this was a matter for the French court to determine.The German broadsheet Süddeutsche Zeitung predicted that the ruling would fundamentally change how German courts assess similar cases, because the assumption since 2002 had been that religious symbols could not be banned from the workplace on anything other than safety grounds. The ruling, which is more nuanced than a straightforward ban, could sow confusion about which religious symbols can be worn at work. Some legal experts said it seemed to cut against a ruling from the European court of human rights (ECHR) that allowed crosses to be worn.Steve Peers, a professor of EU law at Essex University, said the latest ECJ ruling looked awkward when set against the ECHR judgment that wearing religious symbols is “sometimes an employee’s right to manifest freedom of religion”. He said the ECJ had not referred to this case law or attempted to deal with the distinction between freedom of religion and non-discrimination.The ECHR is the high court of the 47-member Council of Europe and not part of the EU. Traditionally, the EU court in Luxembourg confined itself to evening out distortions in Europe’s single market, but its remit has grown as EU law has expanded.The ruling prompted dismay from some religious groups. The Conference of European Rabbis, which comprises 700 Jewish leaders across Europe, said Europe was sending a clear message that its faith communities were no longer welcome. Referring to the rise of racially motivated incidents, Pinchas Goldschmidt, the group’s president, called on politicians to ensure Europe did not isolate religious minorities.Maryam H’madoun at the Open Society Justice Initiative said she was disappointed by the ruling, which she described as discrimination against people who chose to show their religion in their dress. “It will lead to Muslim women being discriminated in the workplace, but also Jewish men who wear kippas, Sikh men who wear turbans, people who wear crosses. It affects all of them, but disproportionately Muslim women,” she said.Stephen Evans, the campaigns director at the National Secular Society in the UK, said: “Where a ban on employees wearing religious or political symbols is founded on a general company rule of religious and political neutrality, and where that rule is applied equally to all, it can’t be realistically argued that that this constitutes ‘less favourable treatment’.“Religious and political neutrality is a perfectly reasonable aim and, where businesses and organisations wish to present themselves in such a way, this ruling demonstrates that this approach is perfectly consistent with equality and human rights law.”Angelique Chrisafis contributed to this report"
900,"Former Indian batsmen VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid constructed a 376-run stand against Australia on March 14, 2001, which is widely considered one of Test cricket's best partnerships in a follow-on innings. Laxman went on to score 281 runs, India's then highest individual Test score, helping India end Australia's 16-match-long world record winning streak."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowBack in the summer of 2001, India were far removed from the modern-day Test giants they were - even on home soil, when a mighty Australia came to visit for a three-Test series.India, it would seem, were hardly prepared for the men from down under. They had been whitewashed 3-0 by the Aussies the previous summer and on their return home, South Africa drubbed them 2-0.There was then the one-off Test against Bangladesh and two more Tests against Zimbabwe. India managed two win two of those but not without stiff resistance from the opposition.And when the much-hyped series against Australia got underway in the March of 2001, there was little doubt who would triumph. The Aussies, led by Steve Waugh, steamrolled India in Mumbai to extend their winning streak.Things looked just as bleak in the next Test at the Eden Gardens. Australia had piled up 445 and India were knocked out for 171 and following on, were tottering at 115/3 when Rahul Dravid joined VVS Laxman in the middle. The Eden crowd was aghast. Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar, the most established batsmen in the team, were gone and Australia were breathing fire.Laxman had shown class in his 21 Tests up until that point - few would have forgotten his 167 in Sydeny. Dravid was considered to be extremely talented but India had yet to see the flair they would go on to produce for the next decade.March 14, 2001 was when they first saw what these two could do. With their backs against the wall, India roared back as Laxman and Dravid orchestrated one of the greatest comebacks in Test cricket. They were 254/4 at stumps on day 3. When the duo resumed proceedings on the fourth day, Australia would have hoped to wrap things up quickly.Instead, Laxman and Dravid played two of the greatest innings ever to add 335 runs to virtually bat Australia out of the game and the series. Laxman went to stumps unbeaten on 275 while Dravid was unbeaten on 155.It was expected Laxman would go on to become the first triple centurion for India but that was not be as he perished for 281. a record that stayed till Virender Sehwag hammered it three years later. Dravid was out for 181 the next day but India had enough on the board to set a pulsating Test match.Harbhajan Singh finished it off with six more second innings wickets as a stunned Australia went down by 171 runs.

Barcelona suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at Deportivo La Coruña, four days after their dramatic 6-1 Champions League win over Paris Saint-Germain. Luis Enrique’s side also lost top-spot to Real Madrid after they beat Real Betis 2-1 last night thanks to a late goal from Sergio Ramos. Zinedine Zidane’s side now lead La Liga by two points and have a game in hand over Barcelona in second. The former Real Madrid youth trainee Joselu gave Deportivo a deserved lead in the 40th minute after an error by the Barça goalkeeper, Marc-André ter Stegen, although Luis Suárez equalised after 46 minutes with a powerful drilled effort.The Depor defender Alex Bergantinos headed them back in front after 74 minutes and Barcelona, who were without Neymar because of a thigh injury and clearly missed the Brazilian’s creative talents, failed to react.Suárez was denied a second equaliser by a brilliant save from Germán Lux as Baecelona suffered a first defeat in 20 league games since being beaten 4-3 at Celta Vigo, also in Galicia, on 2 October.Depor went into the game one place above the relegation zone but are on the rise under new coach Pepe Mel, who has now taken eight points in four games since succeeding the sacked Gaizka Garitano last month.The Galicians were far from intimidated by Barca’s recent run of scoring 17 goals in their previous three outings, and did not allow the champions to settle. Joselu fired a venomous shot at goal in the first real attempt for either side, forcing an outstanding save from Ter Stegen to force a corner.The German let himself down a minute later, though, letting the ball slip out of his hands from a tame shot and Joselu gobbled it up to score from close range.Barca made the ideal start to the second half as Suarez instinctively drilled a loose ball under Lux to pull level, but they could not faze the home side, who soon set about restoring their lead.Alejandro Arribas rattled the post with a header and Deportivo were wrongly given a corner, which they took full advantage of as Bergantinos outmuscled Jordi Alba to head home.“We let them get into the game for too long in the first half and this is what football is like, when you give a team an advantage they always punish you,” Suarez told reporters.“The PSG result did not cost us today, we’ve had enough days to recover. Deportivo are fighting relegation and we knew it was going to be difficult here but we’re not going to give up the fight for La Liga.”"

But BJP with just 13 was quick to gather support of the smaller parties and the independents.In the 40-seat Goa Assembly, a party or coalition requires support of 21 MLAs to form government. Congress has 17 MLAs and BJP only 13 but the latter cobbled together a coalition with nine out of the other 10 MLAs.GFP, MGP AND INDEPENDENT MLAs OFFER SUPPORT Three Goa Forward Party, three Maharashtravadi Gomantak Party and all three independent MLAs met BJP leaders today evening and offered their letters of support.Goa Forward Party president Vijay Sardesai came out of the meeting and announced that they had decided to support BJP to form the government under the leadership of Manohar Parrikar. With Vijai Sardesai were Rohan Khaunte and Sudin. Senior BJP leader Nitin Gadkari and Manohar Parrikar successfully persuaded them to support BJP.The Congress was confident that the independents and smaller Goa parties will come together to support a Congress government since the mandate in Goa went against the previous government. The outgoing government was a BJP government earlier led by Manohar Parrikar.Laxmikant Parsekar had replaced Parrikar as the latter was called by Narendra Modi to become the country's defence minister. Parsekar's popularity dipped soon and the party got a drubbing in the election in which Parsekar lost his own seat. BJP with the support of MGP, GFP & others have stake claim to form the Government in the state of Goa pic.twitter.com/FNyiEQygWF PARRIKAR: A POPULAR FIGURE IN GOA Manohar Parrikar, an IIT graduate, is popular in Goa and enjoys a clean image.

910,"IT services major Infosys became the first India-registered company to be listed on NASDAQ on March 11, 1999. Infosys Technologies was also the first Indian company to be added to the NASDAQ-100 index, which lists 100 largest non-financial stocks in terms of market capitalisation. NASDAQ is the second-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalisation."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowTechnically, however, Infosys is the second Indian company to list on Nasdaq, since the $30 million (Rs 126 crore) US-registered but wholly Chennai-domiciled Cognizant Technology Solutions listed in June 1998.Now the doors are open and we could expect to see at least 10 Indian information technology (IT), pharmaceutical and telecom companies follow Infosys' example over the next two years. By global standards, however, India's presence on Nasdaq will be modest. Some 80 Israeli companies and a good number of companies from Australia, Argentina and South Africa are also on Nasdaq.Nasdaq itself was launched in 1971. Although the most widely-tracked indicator of stock market health, the Dow, is based on its rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), close to 60 per cent of the total share volume and listed companies in the US is on Nasdaq. It is the popular perception that it is an exchange predominantly for IT companies, since its stars have been names like Microsoft, Intel, Oracle and Netscape.Actually, less than 20 per cent of the listed companies are in the IT industry. The bulk are in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, banking, telecom, electronics, oil, transportation and housing. By and large, Nasdaq is home to new, first-generation, technology-driven companies.Already around 20 IT companies founded by Indian-Americans with a total market capitalisation of around $16 billion - like i2 Technologies, Microchip Technologies and Mastech - are listed on it.It is to Infosys' credit that it has been diligently following American accounting principles for the past few years so as to make its debut on Nasdaq easy. The fact that it is a professionally-owned, one-industry company of relatively new vintage helped. Over 80 per cent of its revenues are generated in North America.But a large majority of established, family-owned Indian companies will have to rework their accounts if they wish to seek listing in the US. The American standards are ruthless. In 1993, Daimler-Benz listed on the NYSE. Its reported profit of $370 million under German rules got converted into a $1 billion loss by American standards.This is not so in India. Second, unlike India, the US requires all deferred taxes to be recorded. Third, unlike the US, India allows excess depreciation and provides a choice to the company on the method to be adopted for calculating the depreciation charge.Fourth, unlike the US, the Indian standard recognises the revaluation of fixed assets. Fifth, US accounting standards require gains or losses from foreign currency transactions to be included in determining net income.There are other differences as well - for example, the US does not allow proposed dividend to be accrued and requires current portion of long-term debt to be shown as current liability.The London-based International Accounting Standards Committee, a private-sector body of which the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India is a member, has been pursuing the cause of core, uniform norms to be adopted around the globe.The Americans have been resisting. They argue that their standards are superior, more transparent, less ambiguous and more rigorous.A compromise under the aegis of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, of which the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is a member, is in the offing. In fact the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7 have jointly called for the early adoption of an internationally agreed set of accounting standards, practices and, most crucially, interpretations of rules.It is therefore most timely that Parliament recently approved the setting up of an independent National Accounting Standards Board. At the same time SEBI set up an expert committee to see how our accounting principles and practices can be brought on a par with the best global practice.Our own Nasdaq, the Over-the-Counter Exchange of India, started a few years ago, is dead. The need is for expanding the supply of venture and risk capital. Because we have not done so, entrepreneurs have used public issues to raise venture capital, bringing grief to millions of investors in the process. To multiply Infosys, the venture capital industry and the technology financing system needs to be shaken up.Indian venture capital companies behave like bankers, fearing failure in a business where success means a failure rate of 70-80 per cent. It is said that true venture capitalists are vulture capitalists. The hope lies with foreign venture capital and private equity companies, some of whom are already in India. They should be allowed 100 per cent foreign equity freely and be treated on a par with mutual funds for tax purposes, with the restriction that they invest only in unlisted companies. Exits and repatriations must also be easy.The author is secretary of the AICC's Economic Affairs Department. The views expressed here are his own. He records that he has no financial interest in Infosys-alas.  Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17. What did lockdown achieve then?

The International Cricket Council is planning to send a World XI to Pakistan in late September for a four-match Twenty20 series in Lahore that will look to build on the successful staging of the Pakistan Super League final in the city on Sunday.The four-match series at the Gaddafi Stadium – to be called The Independence Cup to mark the 70th anniversary of partition – is intended to continue the reintroduction of top-level cricket to the country after a near eight-year hiatus. The break resulted from the attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in 2009 and has meant Pakistan, bar one series against Zimbabwe two years ago, have played home internationals at neutral venues.Details of which players will feature in the World XI are yet to be established. Six overseas cricketers – including Kevin Pietersen, Luke Wright and Tymal Mills – withdrew from Sunday’s PSL final following the tournament’s switch from the United Arab Emirates and in light of two bomb blasts in the preceding weeks.England’s Chris Jordan and the Middlesex batsman Dawid Malan, along with the former West Indies captain Darren Sammy, were among the eight who travelled as, amid a military-style security operation that saw the city in lockdown and bulletproof team buses escorted by elite troops, the match passed without incident. Peshawar Zalmi beat Quetta Gladiators by 58 runs.Giles Clarke, the president of the England and Wales Cricket Board, heads the ICC’s Pakistan Task Force that has been looking at ways to end a drought of international cricket and stated the PSL final, while not simply a test run for the World XI series in itself, has shown cricket can be staged in Lahore.“The desire is to give the cricket-starved Pakistani supporters the chance to see some of the world’s finest players in live action,” Clarke said. “The world of cricket needs to help Pakistan, who cannot continue to play their home fixtures overseas. The youth need inspiring, and the national teams need far more cricket played in familiar terrain. Furthermore, the terrorists cannot win and cricket must not give up on Pakistan.”The World XI series overseas team will assemble in Dubai on 17 September, before flying to Lahore for four matches on the 22nd, 23rd, 28th and 29th, and follow a similar security plan to the PSL final, the rehearsals for which were overseen by an ICC delegation who included the ECB’s security director, Reg Dickason.Malan, speaking before playing Sunday’s final, said he made himself available after being talked through the security plans and following guarantees over player and spectator safety. “As soon as they brought out how tough it would be to get to the players, I almost felt it was my duty to come and represent the team and do the right thing by them,” he said. “Despite all the concerns that there have been in Pakistan, there has been an initiative to try to bring top-class cricket back to the country.”"

Clarke: I think Ishant Sharma deserves to be in the team. Bhuvneshwar Kumar is a great player. He has great record against the left-handers, especially against Warner. India would want to get him in the squad. But I think Ishant surely deserves a place.CLICK TO WATCH FULL INTERVIEWQuestion: If it is a good pitch in Bengaluru, which team will have the advantage?Clarke: It is a first innings game... it is very critical to make as many runs in the first innings. Doesn't really matter if you win or lose the toss. You have to get a good score in the first innings. It sets the tone up. We have seen that now in a tough wicket in Pune. Test match is literally over in the first innings. It will be no different in Bengaluru. The wicket will deteriorate over the five days. So, on a good wicket, toss doesn't matter. You just want to score more runs in the first innings.Question: How would you get Steve Smith out?Clarke: Laughs... Smith is in unbelievable form... a lot like Virat Kohli. Some times you have to just watch and applaud when a player is in such terrific form. I think India had a lot of opportunities to get him out in Pune.

They have won the first Test and have the momentum. I think they will go with the same team in Bengaluru.On Ajinkya Rahane: Clarke: I think Rahane is a wonderful player... think India will give him another opportunity. I think India will make a change in Bengaluru. They will go with two spinner - R Ashwin and R Jadeja. I like to see Rahane in the team. If he is good form, that puts India in dominant position.Boria Majumdar: You had dinner with Virat Kohli last night. Give us some insights about his mind.Clarke: Virat Kohli is a strong character. He is ready and focused on the Bengaluru Test. I consider Kohli as the best batsman right now in all formats.Question: What India need to do to win in Bengaluru?Clarke: India need to combat the big four players in Bengaluru. David Warner, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood. If India can keep these four quiet in Bengaluru, they can win the Test match. Michael Clarke: Positive for Australian cricket that they have won the first Test. But they know what challenge lies ahead. I am very impressive with what Virat Kohli said after the Pune loss.Australia now are confident that they can beat India at their own backyard.

Additionally, it retains the iconic Nokia ringtone that became so ubiquitous during the early 2000's.Lastly, and thankfully so, the 3310 has remained a no nonsense feature phone and Nokia has not tried to infuse smart features in the device just for the sake of it.Will you be buying the new Nokia 3310?

960,"Japanese electronics maker Sony has unveiled the 'Xperia XZ Premium', the world's first smartphone with 4K HDR display at ?46,700. The phone's 19-megapixel camera has a memory-stacked sensor, making it world's first smartphone camera that records slow motion video at 960 frames per second. The device runs on Android Nougat and has 4 GB RAM and 64 GB inbuilt storage."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowHot on the heels of Nokia, LG and Huawei's, Sony has unveiled their latest Xperia flagship Smartphone - the Xperia XZ Premium at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona.The Xperia XZ Premium is undoubtedly the company's most exciting device in years and comes with a range of breakthrough features, the chief amongst them being the world's first 4K HDR display in a smartphone. Unlike the LG G6, which has eschewed Qualcomm's latest processor - the Snapdragon 835 in favour of the older Snapdragon 821 in order to gain the first mover advantage over the Galaxy S8, Sony has decided to stick with the 835 for the XZ Premium.The catch here is the fact that the XZ Premium will not be out before Spring, which is quite some time away.Additionally, the smartphone comes with 4GB of RAM, a 3,230mAh battery with QuickCharge 3.0 support and Android 7.0 out of the box. As with previous Xperia's, the power button doubles up as a fingerprint scanner.Also Read:  Nokia 3310 relaunched: What is its price and other questions answeredTouted as a 'game-changing camera', the Sony Xperia XZ Premium comes with an entirely new camera system called the 'Motion Eye' which comes with the world's first memory stacked sensor.Sony has embedded fast memory right into the camera stack which allows the smartphone to capture video at an astonishing 960 frames per second, which is 4 times slower than any other smartphone available today.Sony claims that the ' World's fastest image capture technology in a smartphone' allows the camera to capture instances that occur in the blink of an eye and reveal things beyond what the human vision is capable of seeing.The added memory also brings with it improved predictive capture in the XZ Premium. The device starts to buffer images the moment it detects motion and selects 4 of the best photos by analysing the speed of the moving object.Additionally, the XZ Premium also comes with the same triple-sensor system found in the Xperia XZ, although the sensor's resolution has been reduced slightly to 19 megapixels. It has an aperture of f/2.0 and comes with SteadyShot and an 'Anti-distortion' shutter. On the front, there is a 13MP camera with an aperture of f/2.0 for selfies.Along with the camera, the display is what sets the XZ Premium apart from the competition. It is the first smartphone in the world to come with a 4K HDR display which is 5.5' in size and is also 40% brighter than the Xperia Z5 Premium's panel.The problem with the Xperia Z5 Premium was the fact that there was little or no 4K content available to enjoy on the smartphone. To remedy this, Sony has entered into a partnership with Amazon Prime Video where users will be able to enjoy a selection of 4K HDR content on their smartphones.Lastly, Sony has entered into a partnership with Qualcomm in order to create a new class of devices that are capable of gigabit LTE speeds. The XZ Premium will be the first smartphone to feature the same and offer not only high speeds but much better speeds everywhere.Sony has also announced an updated version of the Xperia XZ dubbed the Xperia XZs. The XZs comes with the same 19MP 'Motion Eye' camera rear camera and 13MP front camera found in the Xperia XZ Premium with the rest of the specifications remaining exactly the same as the XZ.Unlike the XZ Premium though, which will be available sometime in Spring, the XZs will be available in April in three color variants namely Warm Silver, Ice Blue and Black.Also Read:  Sony Xperia XZ review: Being good isn't good enough anymore Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.

Two clubs in the winter sport of bandy raced to put the ball into their own nets 20 times on Sunday and now face disciplinary action.The Russian Super League game in the northern city of Arkhangelsk finished in an 11-9 win for Baikal-Energiya against local club Vodnik. It was 0-0 with 22 minutes to go before Vodnik player Oleg Pivovarov scored three own goals.Baikal-Energiya responded with nine own-goals in quick succession. Not to be outdone, Pivovarov then put the ball into his own team’s goal eight more times in the final seven minutes.Both teams now face “very tough measures,” Russian Bandy Federation president Boris Skrynnik told the Tass news agency.He accused Vodnik of starting the own-goal extravaganza in order to “play against a convenient team” in the upcoming playoffs. Had Vodnik won, it would have faced the league’s reigning champion.The result mattered less to Baikal-Energiya, which was already assured of facing a much weaker club in the playoffs. As a result, its players “decided to have some fun” and score own goals too, Skyrnnik claimed.Not well known outside Russia and Scandinavia, bandy is a relative of ice hockey played on a large outdoor rink with a rubber ball. It’s played at semi-professional level in Russia.Sunday’s game carries echoes of a scandal at the 2012 Olympics in badminton. Eight female players from South Korea, China and Indonesia deliberately made basic errors in the group stage as they tried to manipulate the draw for the next round. All were disqualified from the Olympics.In soccer, a 2002 Madagascan league game reportedly saw the Stade Olympique de l’Emyrne team score a record 149 own-goals as a protest against what they felt was unfair refereeing."

Multiple world champion Manny Pacquiao has agreed to fight Britain’s Olympic silver medallist Amir Khan on 23 April, with both boxers on Sunday confirming their intentions to appear in a “super fight”. The 38-year-old Pacquiao had said four days ago that he and Khan’s management were in discussions for the fight, despite an earlier announcement the Filipino’s next bout would be against Jeff Horn. Pacquiao, however, had said that Horn was one of many possible opponents. The Australian welterweight’s dream fight was slated for the same date in April with Brisbane a likely host, but the school teacher’s hopes have now been extinguished.“Negotiations between team Pacquiao and team Khan have come to terms for the April 23 bout as this is what the fans wanted,” Pacquiao tweeted. The 30-year-old Khan, who won silver as a lightweight at the Athens Olympics, has not fought since last May when he moved up two weight classes to fight middleweight Canelo Álvarez.The much bigger Mexican proved too powerful and the Briton was knocked out in the sixth round and he is likely to drop back to welterweight to fight Pacquiao, who holds the World Boxing Organisation title at the weight. “My team and I have agreed terms with Manny Pacquiao and his team for a super fight,” Khan said on his Twitter page. Pacquiao won the WBO welterweight title last November against American Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas with an unanimous decision.A Horn-Pacquiao fight would have been one of the biggest in Australian boxing history, with the Queensland government backing the push for Suncorp Stadium to host.Horn had released a video on Sunday, cut with excerpts from Donald Trump speeches, calling on Pacquiao to make a fight happen in Brisbane, where he claimed the money on offer was “real” and already in place.

968,"Shiv Sena's tally in recently concluded BMC election rose to 87 on Friday as three independent councillors, who had earlier parted ways with the party, returned to its fold. However, Sena is still short of 27 councillors to touch the halfway mark of 114 seats. This came amid reports that Sena has approached Congress for a post-poll alliance."," Jump to navigationSpeak NowA day after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls threw up a hung verdict, Shiv Sena's tally of corporators rose to 87 today with three party rebels who won as Independent nominees returning to its fold.This gave a slight push to Uddhav Thackeray's efforts to cobble up numbers but reaching the magic figure of 114 seats needed to rule the cash-rich civic body is still a far cry.The development came at a time when both the Sena and its estranged ally BJP which has won 82 seats, are keeping cards close to their chest on the prospects of coming together again to attain power or otherwise.While Snehal More (Vikhroli) and Tulsiram Shinde (Dindoshi) arrived at Matoshree, the Bandra residence of Thackeray, in morning where they were reinducted, Changez Multani (Andheri) extended his support in evening.SENA EYEING ANOTHER TERMThe Sena, which has been in power in the BMC for last 20 years with the BJP being a junior partner, is looking forward for another term. It contested the BMC polls separately by dumping the BJP.Sena is a junior partner of the BJP in Centre and Maharashtra government.However, the resurgent BJP breached the Sena citadel of Mumbai and bagged 82 seats, just two less than Sena's Friday tally of 84.It remains unclear whether the saffron siblings will join the hands again or new combinations will emerge to secure 114 seats.BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari on Friday said the final decision pertaining to the BMC will be taken by core committee of the party, which is meeting here in the evening.WORKING ON NUMBERS FOR MAYORAL ELECTIONWith the fractured verdict restricting their options, Sena and BJP are trying hard to enlist support of as many corporators as possible to stack up numbers ahead of the Mayoral election scheduled next month.Meanwhile, Thackeray reiterated that Sena will install the next Mayor and said he has not yet thought about alliance.According to sources in the Sena, Thackeray will hold a meeting of all senior party leaders and newly-elected corporators at the Shiv Sena Bhavan to decide on the future course of action.BJP'S CLAIMMeanwhile, a BJP leader has claimed three Independent corporators are willing to give support to BJP in the coming days.The BJP's core committee meeting is currently underway in the city to decide its future strategy.In the counting of votes held on Thursday, Sena won 84 seats, BJP 82, Congress 31, NCP 9, MNS 7, AIMIM 3, Samajwadi Party 6, Akhil Bhartiya Sena 1 and Independents 4.ALSO READ |  BMC election results: BJP-Shiv Sena have no option but to come together, says Nitin Gadkari BMC election results: What's next for Raj Thackeray's MNS after the big debacle  WATCH |  BMC election 2017: Is it victory or defeat for BJP with party losing Mumbai?   Covid-19 has spread to 42 new districts since April 17.
